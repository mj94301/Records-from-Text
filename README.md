# Records-from-Text
Take a giant text block from a *.txt file, parse it into individual records, then extract the header and content from each record with appropriate labels.

I used Chat GPT to generate the scripts. The problem is that I couldn't get ONE script to extract both the header info and the Pros-and-Cons info.
