From Cisco Systems Sr. Video Producer (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Thu, 5 May 2016

Pros
The line of work is interesting, and mostly cool projects to work on. My direct team is great. Stable. Work from home option is great.

Cons
There is a definite corporate politics atmosphere, where schmoozing is important the higher up you are. I have experienced a culture of entitlement from execs who believe the world revolves around them.

Advice to Senior Management
Whether you are a blue badge or a red badge, an executive VP or just an intern, when someone is working their butt off to help you, human kindness and humility go a long way.

Great company to work for, well meaning executive management. Great employee friendly policies. Good mobility between groups.

Toxic first line management, no empathy, slave drivers and makes me wonder how & why they promote these clowns.

Advice to Senior Management
Be careful when you promote individual contributors to first line management and train them. Watch them for first year, hear to employee 360 and remove those who do not make a cut.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Great Work Life Balance"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 4 May 2016

Pros
Cisco is one of the few companies that actually provides a true work life balance. Heavy adoption of their collaboration technologies allows for working from home when not traveling.

Cons
Rapid shift in technology over the past few years has resulted in numerous layoffs. Cisco is hiring but weeding out those that aren't adapting to the new world. This should be done once vs many smaller actions.

Advice to Senior Management
Performing the required reduction in headcount once and be done with it. The numerous smaller reductions take a toll on morale. Mobility in the company is limited if you aren't in San Jose.

Pros
Flexible working hours; Good overall health benefits

Cons
A lot of politics to play; Management change frequently, and not every leader understands the business; The idea to change to open space is a bad call. It works some people, but not ALL; No cap award, little recognition, and no salary raise for years; Re-org, lay-off is norm every summer;

Advice to Senior Management
Be consistent, and focus on the right business, and do the right thing. Trust the team, and give the IC enough authority to explore.

Additionally, I was also working with other interns which makes the experience even better. There are many technologies to which I got exposed.

Cons
The environment might feel a bit too corporate. Despite people being friendly, don't get confused that your managers are actually your friends.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Product Manager says "Great place to work, strong future outlook"

From Cisco Systems Product Manager (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 1 May 2016

Pros
Strong work/life balance, Opportunity to work remotely, Improved market position in collaboration, Large organization but trying to bring in agile/startup culture and renovating a lot of the HQ offices with open floor spaces, etc. Would recommend working here to others.

Cons
Large organization still in the process of becoming more agile, so the bureaucracy and slow pace can be a hinderance at times. Many Cisco lifers are passionate about what they're working on, but some seem to be along for the ride, only to do the minimal amount of work necessary (I'm sure most large companies experience this). Lots of senior leadership changes in recent years leads to frequent strategic changes and internal bickering at times.

Advice to Senior Management
I'd suggest focusing on promoting the strong performers and removing the less productive team members. It sounds obvious but doesn't seem to be the case.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 1 May 2016

Pros
Really nice people (both current employees and interns) Great work life balance Perks: Free & on-campus gym with classes, transportation reimbursement Nice location (I was in San Jose, CA) Although I wish the work was more challenging, I had a positive experience overall. My boss was helpful, gave great feedback, and was generally very supportive.

Cons
I didn't have that much to do project-wise which I found to be common with a lot of other interns Culture can be bureaucratic and typical of a large company

Advice to Senior Management
Have a few projects for your interns, even if they're small it's better than nothing.

From Cisco Systems Network Consulting Engineer (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 29 Apr 2016

Pros
I worked with leaders in the field. If you needed to talk to an expert in a given protocol or product you just picked up the phone. Communication was very open. I have nothing but respect for those I worked with.

Cons
Eventually (after over 10 years there)I had to leave to grow my career. In Advanced Services if you don't work at it you can get pigeon-holed.

Advice to Senior Management
At the time I left in 2012, Cisco was deep into outsourcing and offshoring mature software products. The reasoning was sound but in some cases rushed.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Fri, 29 Apr 2016

Pros
We work in offices surrounded by smart, passionate and very friendly people. The company itself is extremely fast paced and proactive. They are always bringing in new tools and initiatives for us to get involved in and try, providing lots of opportunities to communicate and work with people all over the world. It is a great opportunity to build a global network but does take time. Workplace satisfaction is very important therefore we have a range of facilities to use.

Cons
Being a global company has its benefits but also processes can be timely due to its size.

Pros
Good company. You get to work on latest technologies, good HR policies. I have worked in cisco for 6+ years, this company is NOT what it used to be. Good place for freshers to start your career.

Cons
Management is a waste. Boot lickers get the perks, hikes, growth while hard workers get nothing. Too much of management hierarchy. Performance reviews are an eyewash- Manager does what he feels like. Managers practicing regionalism etc Frequent secret layoffs ...

Advice to Senior Management
Managers should me more educated, should understand employee pain points, growth aspects etc. Recognise employee for his/her hard work.

Pros
Job is very flexible. It allows you to work from home and be more productive.

Cons
The fast pace doesn't allow you to solve issues properly. Quick fix is not the best way to create productive processes.

Advice to Senior Management
Some managers specially in Customer Assurance Business Intelligence need to be more professional and treat people with respect. The unprofessional attitude of one specific manager damage the entire organization. Cisco needs to hire and retain managers with people skills who enjoy helping others to succeed without asking to pay any help back. Cisco in general seems to be a very good company, but needs to get rid of those who put the Cisco name down. HR needs to take action on this type of issue in order to fix the company image.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Software Engineer IV says "Great perks,slow growth,does not like to challenge status quo"

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer IV (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Wed, 27 Apr 2016

Pros
Great perks Above average compensation Work from home (WFH) Good technical exposure

Cons
The work gets hectic sometimes. Most of the time you will end up working 10-12 hours a day.Your life becomes Cisco if are not careful. Slow growth specially when you join in grade 8.This is crowded grade and you will have to wait till eternity to get promoted. Yes sir culture. If you challenge the decision of your manager, you are screwed and your growth will be hampered. Overall perks used be great but not anymore. They are taking way benefits one by one. May be in future it will not have as many perks as used to be.

Advice to Senior Management
Have transparent appraisal system. Management takes their own decision regarding promotion and growth and do not feel the need to inform engineers. No HR Exists in Cisco to take care of your issues..so try to have one if you care.

Cons
Just a personal thing, I was hired for a contract I was given very little information about. It was stupid of me to take it. It was the easiest job I got. Just an overall telephone call with the manager, and a simple tech phone screen. It would be great to work there permanently, and hired

From Cisco Systems Project Manager (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 26 Apr 2016

Pros
Great caliber of people to work with. The best and brightest in all areas. Fast paced, great comp and benefits

Cons
Recent years have seen a shift in corporate culture. Thought Cisco has always been focused on profit and growth it was always done with the employees in mind. Recent pressures of the stock holders and the IT market have seen a shift to more main stream corporate operating cultures. Lay-offs are more common in Cisco now and there is less alignment between what the CEO "says" is the focus and what is actually executed. The word "family" has a diminished meaning in the Cisco culture. Less reward for performance at the discretion of line managers.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't loose site of what made Cisco great and able to grow to be the giant that it is.

Pros
Good work-life balance, manager is supportive and hands-off, newer buildings are furnished nicely, snacks available in new buildings, gym has everything you can ask for.

Cons
Cisco has been stuck in a "market transition" over the last few years. Although our profits are still good, we've still yet to capitalize on the "internet of everything".

Advice to Senior Management
More transparency from the upper management in the direction of things to come. Don't just blurt out big words. I want to see more graphs and tables on our performance, and concrete things we're doing to take things to the next level.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Cisco through Vendor"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 25 Apr 2016

Pros
Cisco has some very difficult problems to solve and is a good place to find enterprise-level design issues in nearly all IT functions. Compensation is decent, more so if you are a remote contributor. Remote contribution is not only possible but the norm in many sub-groups within IT functions where that is possible. (i.e. web work)

Cons
If working through a vendor you may be required to fund your own travel to your department site and this may vary from occasional to often depending on function; this must be considered. Working with offshore teams is expected in many groups and this may result in some odd working hours. Culture can be poor to non-existent, especially for remote workers, be prepared to bring your own.

Advice to Senior Management
Convert more of your best contingent staff to salaried employees once their skill and commitment is apparent.

Pros
Good work-life balance makes working there very appealing. Cisco embraces telecommuting and has all the tech to make this happen.

Cons
Constant reorganization makes it difficult to gain momentum in your career. HR is a partner for upper management and usually on visible during reorganizations or layoffs.

Advice to Senior Management
Start a genuine process about employee development. Employees are very US centric. Need to start thinking more globally and encouraging employees to do so well. International assignments would be a great start.

great benefits, work life balance, love the CEO, in a great place in the market. whats not to love?

Cons
not many cons. i'm in finance, so i don't see the stress of the TS employees or delivery. the work is HARD, but engaging and a great development opportunity.

Advice to Senior Management
focus more on the market and where Cisco makes sense to fit. we doubled down on the cloud, but don't think we had a strategy in place. execs need to work together. its embarrassing seeing VPs not communicating or interlocking the way that finance analysts do - you're the leadership of the company, so act like it.

From Cisco Systems Associate (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Fri, 22 Apr 2016

Pros
Overall, colleagues were simply awesome. Everyone is super friendly but your experience completely depends on the people you work with and the vertical you are in. If your vertical isn't a focus area, you'll probably be bored. If your vertical is a focus area, you will get absolutely smoked but learn a ton. Fridays are pretty laid back. If you aren't on a deal, you should be able to work from home or SF if interested. Relocation assistance is probably best-in-class....make sure to ask for it $10-20K. It's baked into your fully burned opex cost, so theoretically the org has planned for it. Don't be afraid to ask: get the offer and then ask HR. Bus Shuttle from SF->SJC Yearly off-site Executive exposure - you sit on the same floor as C-suite and work with SVPs often. The engineers are super nice and approachable.

Cons
Wages stay flat YoY. No inflation adjustment for junior deal team members. Working remotely isn't really an option outside of Friday Unreal revolving door environment Work/life balance can be non-existent OG environment

Advice to Senior Management
Allow applicants to meet their potential team in person before joining even if it's a junior role. Small teams are a marriage. TelePresence isn't the same thing as meeting someone in person. It's not aggressive to expect an inflation adjustment. The bay area is kind of expensive and younger employees rarely own property. If you get called back while on PTO, you shouldn't have to cover the cost of the ticket and other miscellaneous expenses...that's just mean.

Pros
Fast paced environment (for a big company); Smart people that work hard and play hard. Genuinely committed to our customers success

Cons
Has become too bureaucratic; internal systems not built for shift to cloud/SaaS models, yearly layoffs hurt morale (we'll see if Chuck changes this); too many layers of management

Advice to Senior Management
Chuck Robbins has breathed new life into Cisco, with more direct communications and monthly roundtables where all questions are fair game. Continue to engage and communicate with employees and the Cisco culture will flourish. Also, be mindful of hiring practices so we don't become like every other large tech company that has annual layoffs.

From Cisco Systems Technical Leader (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 19 Apr 2016

Pros
I was always afraid of joining a behemoth of a company: afraid to lose my creativity and individuality. Of course, you're a small fish in a large ocean at Cisco, but I've come to realize/understand that everything (your enjoyment, focus, motivation, loyalty, and on and on) hinges directly on the business unit (BU) and managing chain you're brought into. I was extremely fortunate to have landed in an up-and-coming BU that is constantly heralded as a "do not fail" BU which really keeps you positive. If anything, do your homework and talk to multiple people that work directly in or with your team under the same direct chain of management and pray you'll not be working under an old-school type that refuses to learn new technologies and practices. Some of those guys refuse to accept that it's 2016 and the world has moved on :) Below are some things I find great about working here (keeping in mind both my manager and director are wicked smart and easy-going if you're a hard worker and can prove you're a solid engineer): * a fantastic work from home policy - I refuse to uproot my family and slog it out in CA where home prices are 4-5x more, so I get an income that basically no other local company can match in overall compensation without moving more into the senior manager/VP positions * benefits are great - my family uses the high deductible plan which works well for us if you can build up enough buffer in your HSA and take advantage of the hundreds of dollars of HSA incentives; paid life insurance; paid short- and long-term disability * structured bonus plan - the bonus is nothing to laugh at and is extremely welcome; it's tied to both your performance (kind of derived by your manager) and the companies metrics (customer service quality, shareholders, revenue, etc) but if both do well your percentage goes up * 4.5% match, immediately vested, 401k-roth option, brokerage option, bonus matching, bonus stock (4-year vesting) * BU-dependent, but budget for training, conferences, books, classes, etc are all very good if you choose to use them * perks galore - I guess I didn't realize that with thousands of employees comes greater purchasing power, so various discounts on anything from Whirlpool appliances and movie tickets, to reduced cell phone bills and (I kid you not) solar panel installs. You may not use all of what's available or even care, but to even provide so many different ways to save you cash on things you're going to buy will lead to more compensation * the career path and income increases in all former jobs has been engineer, senior engineer, (maybe principal), manager, glass ceiling...then what? More management? At Cisco they have two paths: management and engineering. The roles and responsibilities increase as you go up levels in either of those paths, as well as the pay and perks, however, they understand that good engineers may want to remain engineers, and they reward their great ones accordingly. I think this is in my top 3.

Cons
* Kind of an ongoing reorganization (aka, forced layoffs) discussion that seems to have been a strong theme the last few years, but nothing really negative as happened yet. I believe there's a severance package if this does happen to you? * Like many places, your peers could be complete duds, which forces you to pick up their slack or else the entire team including yourself look terrible...but, without any "real" guidelines in place to let these people go they kind of hang around and leach off the company and their peers * I've been here over a year and through various conversations with my peers I've discovered that I should probably be a level above where I'm at now, however it is not really clear at all how you move up

Advice to Senior Management
* Find a way to weed out the bad eggs from the solid, capable engineers. Some of them are literally stealing money from you by not working. And try to do it in a way where you insulate the good engineers from getting caught up in a "re-org" net. * The benefits, perks, pay, etc are all stellar in my opinion and I think really sets Cisco apart from some of the competitors. Keep that up and reward your workforce for staying. * Keep innovating to attract new talent to fuel the future. I think some of the recent moves at the higher levels have been truly great and hopefully will stabilize soon so everyone can focus on the mission.

-so vast and process laden, really difficult to get things done swiftly -super slow release cycles -the offices are really crappy looking and dated (except for 1-2 buildings in SJ) -all that work from home makes you feel like a shut in -all that work from home drives an email culture which is slow and less collaborative -alot of waste, inefficiency, and lack of basic tech proficiency -insane amounts of managing up

Advice to Senior Management
look for ways and workers who improve efficiency and let them lead. stop employing wasteful people. Stop the managing up cycle and do some of your job as actual managers.

Pros
Dynamic Environment Strong Company Culture Career Opportunities Always New and Challenging Contact with Management Structure Strong focus on training and learning

Cons
Some of it's Pros are sometimes it's Cons: the speed of change is incredible, which makes it both exciting and difficult to keep up.

Advice to Senior Management
The open-door culture at CISCO closes the gap between management and the individual contributor. That availability is key to the positive experience at CISCO. If anything, the advice would be to improve on cross-functional communication.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems IT Intern says "Summer Internship Review"

From Cisco Systems IT Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 17 Apr 2016

Pros
As an intern, I felt there was a real camaraderie among all the interns, and this was encouraged by the managers. Also, the managers I worked under were results oriented. They did not care whether you were an intern or full time worker, and they treated both equally. Once my manager was aware of my skills, he gave me just as much responsibility as any other employee, and I felt I fit in with my team very well.

Cons
A downside of being treated exactly like the other employees was that since this was my first internship, or even real job, at moments I did feel a bit overwhelmed at times since I wasn't used to work like that. However, it was comforting that the managers thought highly enough of my skills to give me such assignments.

Advice to Senior Management
The internship program is very well done, and I have few complaints with the way those things were done. That program can be kept the way it is. Perhaps, ensure that the interns have time to participate in the events, along with the assignments.

Pros
Great company, great leadership, great products ... and a great willingness to disrupt ourselves to address the challenges ahead, and to be the #1 IT company in the world!

Cons
Great companies have to make tough challenges to survive. Unfortunately that means difficult employee decisions, such as a layoffs.

Pros
Lots of perks. Decent money. Quality cafeterias. Nice campus amenities. Most teams seem to like to laugh.

Cons
They call it "Agile Methodologies," but they should call it "spend half your day in meetings, explaining why you're behind schedule." Difficult to collaborate as a team when you're spread over twelve timezones.

Advice to Senior Management
Skip the management and organizational fads. Access the real cost of forcing teams spread across twelve timezones.

Will not be really dynamic for young people(generally, not the internship program) No official full-time conversion chances Lack of connection to HR

Advice to Senior Management
Experience is pretty different by business unit. Effort to have more energetic atmosphere

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Sales says "Great technology, talent"

From Cisco Systems Sales (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 13 Apr 2016

Pros
Some very talented people. Those who perform will succeed. Poor performers usually weeded out. Products, solutions, and services that can be confidently sold. Good work/life balance.

Cons
High pressure. Always a looming feeling of impending restructuring. Trend towards reducing overheads by hiring lower-cost early-in-career resources. This is a pro if you're early-in-career.

Advice to Senior Management
Frequent transparent communication does a lot to instill confidence in the workforce, even when the news is bad. Don't keep them guessing.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Acquisitions says "Decent place to work"

From Cisco Systems Acquisitions (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 13 Apr 2016

Pros
Great people to work with. At times work is challenging. Not so hard to move around between groups. Relentless focus on execution, however, sometime ready, fire, aim. Biggest plus is Flexible work - just get your work done, people don't care where you are (That said, some groups do)

Cons
Very big - tiny cog in big machine - hard to make a difference Constant focus on you adjusting to change - just not changing any of the pre-year 2000 systems. Lots of talk about digitization, but operationally really falling behind - unable to support new business models Promotions are very hard. Raises and high bonuses are only really given to top performers

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on making Cisco easy to do business with. You make partners work too hard. If it were easier, you'd make a lot more money off of the partners. Also stop doing share buy-backs and invest in the company. Rebecca is clearly not the one to revamp the antiquated operational infrastructure - bit the bullet and modernize.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 12 Apr 2016

Pros
Cisco is a company that believes treating its employees well and invests heavily to maintain that culture. The even have things like on site day care, a really nice gym, and on site doctors with a pharmacy. As far as the business is concerned it is still a monster generating a lot of cash but it still primarily comes from Routing and Switching - a market that is being disrupted.

Cons
Lots of red tape and politics. In recent years the company has had little growth and with a lower turnover rate due to a good work environment it creates challenges for people to move up even when they are more than ready.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus more on results and less on what looks good. Often times what looks good gets rewarded over actual results.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 12 Apr 2016

Pros
- Strong and passionate community committed to Cisco's success - Smart people - Leadership honors commitment to grow people by giving rotation opportunities across the company

Cons
- Frequent organizational adjustments can be disruptive at times. Have seen resources change direct reporting relationships four times within 2 months. - Can be a fair amount of politics across teams, although no worse than I've seen at other companies.

Advice to Senior Management
Recommend that leadership continues to candidly address the direction of the company and ongoing changes. Since change is inevitable, maintaining the open dialogue and giving insight into the thinking of the leadership team will be important to keep employees focused, happy and moving in the same direction.

From Cisco Systems Sales Enablement (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 11 Apr 2016

Pros
The autonomy of employees in addressing their quotidian assignments renders this particular corporate institution a cromulent choice for employment, should one be presented with that opportunity.

Cons
The diffused and networked nature of the organizational structure within this collective enterprise (mirroring its most successful products' ultimate consequence) occasionally served to create a sense of anomie.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 10 Apr 2016

Pros
Best culture to work in. Really amazing people. Job was both fun and challenging. Everything was designed to make you feel good about working at Cisco.

Cons
There is a ceiling for advancement I felt. Not really forthcoming in career advances based on purely work done. A little bit of politics involved.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep doing what you doing. Just listen to employees a bit more.

Pros
There is a lot of flexibility with working from home; great work life balance

Cons
It used to be that you'd spend every year wondering if you'd make the cut. Now you spend every quarter wondering if you'll have a job.

Advice to Senior Management
Park your egos, get some technical understanding and treat your engineering teams better.

From Cisco Systems Business Analyst III (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Thu, 7 Apr 2016

Pros
This is a large company with great benefits. They love to hire from within and there are lots of opportunities.

Cons
Cisco has gone to the layoff model to management. Their people have become disposable while middle management continues to grow and protect each other. There are too many managers with an inconsistent message. Half of the managers appreciate their employees and work with them to help them advance in their careers. Others want people that are going to stay in the same job forever.

Advice to Senior Management
Start showing your employees they matter instead of just disposing of them.

Cisco has the latest technology. The full-time regular employees can attend many different trainnings for the job that s/he is working on.

Cons
Performance reviews using the peer systems sometimes are not fair. You've been asked to give the peer list, but the manager may choose one from his list at his convenience.

Advice to Senior Management
Need to be less on politics. Focus more on work and talent.

Advice to Senior Management
The recent changes in HR, removing the ratings systems, have changed Cisco's culture for the worse. Something is wrong when good performers are fired, and non-performers are still there.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 5 Apr 2016

Pros
Excellent benefits that allow for flexibility. Working remotely is supported and made possible by our amazing collaboration technology (WebEx, TelePresence, Jabber, and more). You're encouraged to innovate in your job and try something new if it will benefit a program. People are very open and friendly to newcomers. I've found that people are generally willing to share their career journeys and lessons learned. Plenty of internal development opportunities (stretch assignments, rotations, internal reqs, etc).

Cons
It's a big company, so it takes a while to know who to contact to get things done quickly.

Cons
Took away our stock options, felt like abandoning us from feeling ownership in the company. For the veterans that have been there since year 2000, many feel that our underwater stock options should have been replaced with new ones, since we stuck it through supporting the company in the ups and downs. Lack of salary adjustments for veterans who have been in the company 15+ yrs

Advice to Senior Management
in the recent 3 years. Management has really changed and are open to making changes to boost morale. I think this is great and should be continued to stay competetive in the valley. Bring back some more small perks, like soft drinks, more team lunches, etc.

From Cisco Systems Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 5 Apr 2016

Pros
Great field experience and exposure to a fast pace corporate environment. Impossible not to learn something about work or yourself every day. You will have stuff to do all the time.

Cons
Bureaucracy and rigid even though some of the "start up" perks are trying to be thrown in to make the place seem hip.

Advice to Senior Management
Youths are more interested in working in a place that thinks like a start up rather than one that desperately tries to look like one. I think some organizational changes could be made to lessen the burden of hierarchy. Maybe the culture will change on its own over time.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 5 Apr 2016

Pros
The company is more open to teleworking than most. The products are solid and the technology is interesting. Benefits are competitive.

Cons
Career opportunities are limited. If you don't live near a corporate office, you'll be limited. If you are an account manager, you can become CEO. If you are an engineer, you'll always be an engineer. Very few are allowed to escape the title.

Advice to Senior Management
The company seems more reactive than it has in the past. It has compensated well for previous missteps but I don't know if future challenges will be avoided or not.

Pros
Great employee support, ancillary benefits and encouragement to explore and participate in all areas of the business to help network cross-functionally. Cutting edge technology, excellent management, feels like family.

Cons
Large company any way you slice it. My group seemed excessively political leaving control in the hands of someone that should not have control.

Advice to Senior Management
Continue cross-fertilizing of ideas and making every effort to make the company feel small--this will help when competing against smaller more nimbler companies for employees.

Pros
Good pay, good benefits. Free coffee.

Cons
Whatever you do avoid the projects that manage large numbers of servers. Poor engineering of products. Documentation is lacking. In my job the debug / edit / compile cycle was approximately 1 hour (versus a few minutes at most other companies). This is due to bad choices made in engineering, and the cost on current employees is very high. Cisco does not "eat its own dogfood." So the complex task of managing hundreds of servers is not deployed at Cisco. Furthermore, the company isn't willing to invest much in hardware. You'll be forced to use "simulators" to debug things, being that there is no big set of hardware to use. Also, if you are not Asian you may not "fit in". Don't expect the other employees to be very friendly or helpful.

Advice to Senior Management
Hire managers with integrity.

Pros
Investment and focus on innovation makes it an exciting place to work. Culture from top management of respecting individuals flows down and across the company.

Cons
Many managers lack the management skills to truly develop their teams. Company has the people process but not a culture that promotes excellence in management of people. Too much of the innovation investment and energy is wasted. Don't always see the tangible results delivered.

Advice to Senior Management
Strengthen the link between excellence in management, measurement of results and the innovation investment.

Pros
Big company, a lot to learn. Complex business processes, good place to polish your business and management skills. Prepare yourself to be worked to death since everything is around California time which makes it very tough for employees outside the US to take on calls, TPs, etc at normal hours since they will have to adapt to Pacific time.

Cons
Too political. Corporate is not fully aware of what happens in the regions, same people have been running the regions for years and have formed silos and closed environments that make it impossible for other people to move up.

Advice to Senior Management
Investigate what happens in the regions and make sure you rotate the key positions to allow fresh ideas to come in and benefit the operation.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Marketing says "Good Company with Some Issues Around Upward Mobility and Stuffiness"

From Cisco Systems Marketing (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sat, 2 Apr 2016

Pros
Cisco provides good compensation, benefits, and (with many positions) flexibility to work remotely. The people who work at Cisco are intelligent, respectful and nice.

Cons
As an older tech company the culture can be a bit stuffy. Cisco is trying to fix this and encourage young people to come/stay but there is still work that needs to be done.

Advice to Senior Management
Upward mobility is limited by the fact that there are so many people that have been at Cisco for 10+ years. This is a good thing in terms of showing the loyalty that employees have, but is not good for keeping new employees around.

Pros
Getting familiar with a large company is useful for an intern deciding what to do after graduation.

Cons
There wasn't enough work for an intern with little prior experience, so it wasn't challenging enough.

Advice to Senior Management
Have more small projects available for a better learning experience.

Pros
I am one of the Global co-Leads for our Connected Black Professionals organization. The fact that Cisco has an organization like this is a testament that the company honors inclusion and diversity. I also have had GREAT managers that have both challenged and supported me.

Cons
Making the transition from a Sales roles to a Program Management role has been challenging and it would be helpful to have mentors that can help you through this process.

From Cisco Systems Network Consulting Engineer (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Fri, 1 Apr 2016

Pros
Good people, good resources, good projects. The contract pay was quite good. I had some excellent managers and team members.

Cons
Apparently there is some sort of rule that the Cisco manager you report to cannot provide any type of feedback. My manager seemed to be great. Every time we met on the phone, he acted as if all was well. He never provided any feedback or coaching. He was very friendly. I was offered a full time position many times, but had to turn it down because the pay was nothing short of abysmal. Then, a very hostile customer complained about me for a rather invalid reason. My project manager and team had my back and were in my corner. They all explained to my manager that I was not at fault. Suddenly, my contract was terminated. No explanation, no communication. I tried to talk to him just to understand, but he completely cut me off and wouldn't talk to me. If you are thinking about contracting at Cisco, then I strongly caution you. If you are perfect, then all will be well. If you do anything that causes the slightest bit of concern, then your contract will be terminated. They won't warn you, they won't talk to you, they'll just give you the ax. There is a very stark difference between contractors ("Red Badges") and employees ("Blue Badges"). Contractors get a paycheck and absolutely nothing else. That is to be expected in many situations, but I wanted to make it clear for those less experienced in contracting.

Advice to Senior Management
Would it kill you to provide feedback to your people? Even if they are contractors? Can you not provide the slightest bit of coaching? Can you not talk frankly to your teams and give them the knowledge they need for improvement?

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "direction changes..."

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Tue, 29 Mar 2016

Pros
great talent in the company esp in the engineering area. People are (for the most part) passionate and dedicated to their customers

Cons
too many changes in direction...can't make up its mind on key aspects of the business, and too "cliquey" at the top, making for a bit of a "club" atmosphere. Tough for newcomers, esp mid and senior career professionals

Advice to Senior Management
good luck...the culture has changed at Cisco, and the company will pay the price for it through lack of employee engagement and transparency

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 28 Mar 2016

Pros
Lots of smart people around Great company to learn how to handle complex business problems Very flexible work culture even when you have lots of deliverables to handle Competitive salary if you do not compare it to the top 5% highest paying companies in the valley

Cons
Cisco is in the middle of lots of leadership changes; lots of confusion around company direction Switching business, which is 1/3rd the entire companies business is going through a lot of confusion

Advice to Senior Management
There are lots of great leaders in the company as has been the case for couple of decades now. Some of the higher management people are trying to do the right things for the company whereas some of them are too worried about their own growth within the company. That is creating a lot of struggle for the company to have a solid overarching vision and execution of that vision. Please unite.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 28 Mar 2016

Pros
Great daycare program and convenient health center. On-site gym for employees to use from 6am to 9pm. Year-end shutdown across the company for one week. Most managers are open to working from home 1-2 days a week.

Cons
Compensation package is low compared to other companies in the valley. Company does not have a well promoted career development program to allow rotations for individual contributors. Hence not enough opportunities within the company for rotation to get experience outside of your domain.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Mon, 28 Mar 2016

Pros
Cisco is a well-established company. It has a solid stock value. The company has a strong footprint in all six continents. Its brand is well-known internationally.

Cons
Cisco portfolio is not focused and is all over the map. They try to compete in niche markets that are not well-suited for the company core business. They do not have much potential for growth.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on core deliverables and less on all the shiny new objects. When it comes to initiatives, Cisco is known for now following through, ending up with half-baked internal products that suffer from lack of funding. There is a continuous focus on the new shiny objects rather than perfecting what is already there.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 28 Mar 2016

Pros
Plenty of resources, intelligent people, nice campus. If you're smart and capable, and can network (people-wise), you'll be fine here. If you're coming in from a jack-of-all-trades background and going in to a silo, make sure you understand that you're in a silo now and some things are not your responsibility.

Cons
You're in a silo where you're not allowed to fix things you might know how to fix. Like other big companies, some tasks are outsourced to folks that follow a script, which can make troubleshooting slow and onerous.

Advice to Senior Management
None right now - most of what I've seen has been positive. There's a drive to improve things internally, to recognize hard works, and provide the right kinds of resources.

Pros
- Good culture - Good work, life balance

Cons
- too many re-orgs - during my tenure of 1.5 years, I went through 3 re-orgs. It may cause good in long run but I have seen it causing lot of noise and discomfort to the engineers.

From Cisco Systems Customer Support Engineer (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sun, 27 Mar 2016

Pros
Great company, lots of online training and equipment you can borrow and setup labs.

Cons
Working with other department is difficult. Most TAC try to avoid taking ownership. Everyone cares more about closing tickets than customer service. Most engineer do the bare minimum to close the ticket. This is probably due to management and their concerns with metrics.

Advice to Senior Management
Metric is not everyone. Just because someone have less service request doesn't mean they are doing the right thing, vice versa. Last, expectation from Cisco Manager and Contractor is not on the same page. One care more about certifications, while the other care more about metrics.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Fri, 25 Mar 2016

Pros
Great outlook, great opportunity, will be the #1 IT Company in the world (if not already there), a super-survivor, awesome & super-smart colleagues, great benefits, global presence, aspiring to given women more opportunities (and half the Senior Leadership team is women), conveys great San Francisco Bay Area values and respect for people

Cons
Can end up working off-shift or after hours due to the global nature of the IT Industry, however this is balanced with mostly accepting & flexible managers -- to be honest, there are no real "Cons" in working for Cisco, unless the commute is killing you...

Advice to Senior Management
Consider more streamlined marketing messaging, ie focus on a few top-level campaigns, with other messaging supporting these -- not sure that the general public can speak to what a great company Cisco is based on current messaging.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 25 Mar 2016

Pros
Compensation is higher than normal for Greater Atlanta Area IT sector. If you're in the right group, you can be shielded from most of the upper level management shenanigans, politics and bad business decisions. If you're not in the right group - all bets are off.

Cons
Cisco has a habit of acquiring companies and then destroying them. This is certainly the case with their acquisition of Scientific Atlanta, all traces of which will certainly cease to exist within the next two years. Upper level management is a revolving door and there is a high level of chaos as folks scramble to maintain employment - often working on projects that have very little chance of succeeding.

Advice to Senior Management
Streamline and focus on doing a few things well, rather than doing a large number of things badly.

From Cisco Systems Senior Marketing Manager (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 4 of 4 found this helpful — Thu, 24 Mar 2016

Pros
Flexible schedules, telecommuting, and great people to work with. Some employees truly know their stuff and interested in making a difference.

Cons
Lots of politics as middle managers who have been with the company for years try to hide their inadequacies. No discipline or accountability. Check-list marketing approach as opposed to trying to understand and build relationship with customer. Constant layoffs of very capable people. Lots of employees do the minimum to get by. Management tries to be hip by offering "bring your dog to work" pilot, free snacks, and one free lunch/week.

Advice to Senior Management
Quit the cheerleading, focus on accountability, and make things happen.

Pros
They have been extremely supportive to me through my personal medical issues. Been with the company for 14+ years and I am quite sure I would not get the same respect from other companies.

Cons
Company is big - and changing direction can be more challenging. That said, they have made some massive changes at the top that is driving a completely new culture.

Pros
The most comfortable job you can get - especially in operations. Very few deliverables, low expectations and option for remote work allows for unrivaled work life balance.

Cons
Not a lot of direction or unity. Powerpoint and politic-driven culture. Incentive is to identify a problem, build a team, and then drag it out as long as possible.

Advice to Senior Management
Trim the fat and pay half the people twice as much. Give up on the RTP location strategy - costing top talent.

Pros
Great knowledgeable people and most managers are too.

Cons
The constant re-orgs in Cloud services hasn't helped become a more nible organization.

Advice to Senior Management
Make sure the people who are promoted, are as good as the candidates you'd hire from the outside. Also, remove the Red Badge / Blue Badge disparity. It's so uneven its like discrimination.

Pros
Company has lots of different technologies to pick from. If you have the opportunity to get in, it's a great place to start a career, but with the intention of leaving 1-2 years into the job.

Cons
1) Tons of red tape 2) Processes for everything. If there isn't a process, it can't be done and changing the process is nearly impossible. 3) Seemingly yearly layoffs 4) Not particularly innovative. 5) Depending on your management, YMMV.`

Advice to Senior Management
My management was awful. I would advise that Cisco work on providing leadership to their teams, or allowing those in the team that can lead the ability to do so.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Sun, 20 Mar 2016

Pros
Good entry level position at a prestigious company. The people are friendly and there perks here that help enhance the working conditions.

Cons
Most of the workers in my department are non-citizens from either India or Pakistan, who tend to know very low skilled. Many contractors are laid off or retained on a quarterly basis, depending on the quarterly budget. This creates a tense atmosphere since many workers worry if they'll still have a job in a couple of months. No one should have to work with a sword constantly hanging over their heads like that. So, I'm not thrilled with Cisco's abusive hiring practices, which prioritizes low cost over qualified workers.

Advice to Senior Management
Invest more resources and time in training up your workers AND in maintaining their skill levels.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sat, 19 Mar 2016

Pros
Lots of networking opportunities as an intern to learn about various departments and functions at Cisco.

Cons
Did a lot of paper pushing as an MBA intern. Not much growth or knowledge gained from projects that may help within product management or marketing. Bit disappointment. Perhaps it may have just been bad luck on my part getting an internship on a team that did not value giving projects to MBA interns that would be challenging.

Advice to Senior Management
Just make sure when you go for the internship interview, you make sure you understand what kinds of projects you will be working on and whether you will be challenged and utilize what you are learning in school.

Pros
Flexibility to work remote and constant learning experience.

A big portion of the company is made up of contractors. Will continue to lose potentially great employees because hiring is so rare.

Advice to Senior Management
Make it easier on the Engineering Leads that have to put up with training contractors on a constant basis because retention rates are low. Hire those who will fit in to the team and you will have better results.

Pros
Cisco is an extremely diverse company with many great opportunities. There are pockets of innovation that help to drive the company forward. Additionally, cookie Fridays were delicious!

Cons
Because Cisco is a relatively older company for the industry, and such a large corporation, it tends to move much slower, and there are various loopholes and areas that can get frustrating.

Advice to Senior Management
Spread information on training programs and have a clear line of communication from team to team.

Advice to Senior Management
Think seriously about the effect that the frequent layoffs have one the employees who are left. These are very demoralizing and effects productivity.

From Cisco Systems Low Level Engineer Doing the Work (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 4 of 4 found this helpful — Thu, 17 Mar 2016

Pros
Good pay and benefits. Can be interesting work in the write department. Top level and bottom level workers are good at what they do. If you have good social skills and want to climb up the ladder then there are good opportunities if your face fits.

Cons
Lower management is a joke and more like a boys club. Priorities are themselves, then the project then if there is any time/energy left their staff. They lack of knowledge on how to handle exceptional engineers/people, the ones who come with side effects, so good is the best they will get/keep. The top people at the bottom (i.e. the engineers doing the work) often do not have great social skills and management can't handle them no matter how good they are at their job of for the project.. You have to spend more time looking after your career than doing the job if you want to climb, it's not a place to survive at the bottom level for long. If you want to stay hand's on then Cisco isn't for you no matter how good you are.

Advice to Senior Management
Look at the lower management. Promote moral of workers. Stop looking for faults in the staff and look/exploit their good points.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Software Engineer I says "Campus Hires are paid more than Engineers with 3-4yrs experience"

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer I (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Thu, 17 Mar 2016

Pros
Work is chilled out, not very challenging... Even if it was challenging/engaging at any time, i never had to move beyond my comfort zone to meet expectations. Cab service is good. New buildings are good (BGL17,18). Older buildings look like 10yr old govt offices

Cons
Pay is pretty low compared to market standards. They don't seem to normalize salaries. New campus hires are paid more than Software Engineer-II (3-4 yr exp band) annual increments are usually around 10% and on promotion around 5-10%.

Advice to Senior Management
Management needs to address growing attrition rate. pay is much lower than market value for the ppl working in cisco. The only place where they make an effort to correct it is in campus hiring (they do this only for the fear of not getting enough candidates from NITs and IITs, as companies visiting their campuses offer much more) but the problem is they hire college freshers paying much more than existing employees in cisco, like college freshers who have joined 3-4 yrs ago. Management is doing a very poor job when it comes to normalizing pay, and there exists vast disparity in pay within the organization. 3yrs exp person getting lower pay than a fresh college hire in the same team is fundamentally wrong. No self respecting engineer will continue to stay in the organizations after learning about this kind of disparity. However the management seems to be ignoring this issue and i didnt get a proper response when i raised it. Ultimately, there is very high attrition rate in the 0-8yrs experience bracket, primarily due to low pay.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 16 Mar 2016

Pros
The people and benefits at Cisco are generally good. The company is highly focused on areas of strategic importance and growth. You want to work in one of these areas of the business.

Cons
Not unique to Cisco, a high percentage of managers and above are only interested in promoting themselves. Managers truly interested in developing members of their teams are rare. If you are in an area of the business that is stable or declining you need to watch your back. Limited Restructuring has become the norm for cutting headcount (costs) on a regular basis. With few exceptions, senior management exempts themselves from such accountability resulting in productive people being cut. Very little opportunity for advancement.

Advice to Senior Management
Leadership sometimes requires developing emerging technology and business models that compete with the status quo.

It was a 15 year old legacy product and the work involved bug fixing and responding to customer issues. No development work as such. Would never recommend a fresher to join the company.

Pros
Competitive salary and abundance of additional work available. I'm sure that Cisco is one of the more generous employers, but time will tell.

Cons
It is possible to have your personal time consumed by the company. That said, there does seem to be some autonomy within departments and depending on your immediate leadership the experience can be quite good for you.

Large company and can feel a little stodgy at times and slow to move. Much of the recent innovation and revenue has been acquired vs. developed organically and future growth drivers remain elusive.

Pros
You have a job until you can find a new one. Your colleagues all know the game there, it is just a job for now...most people will be gone within a year, that is usually everyone's plan. The contract agencies like Apex and Insight just keep billing Cisco 40-50% more than you are paid so at least you know up front there is no loyalty or expectations of a long-term career here.

Cons
You will be asked to work "off the clock" as an hourly employee. I have lost count of how many times I have heard this happening in all different departments (Telepresence, activations, security, foundations, etc.) Any questions about this violation in law and ethics will be perceived as you "not being a team player" and you will be getting a call from your agency asking you to lock your workstation and turn in your badge. ***READ your contract agencies fine print *** you are giving up time and a half ("overtime"), you are paying about 7% more in payroll taxes, you are basically forced to accept a dispute resolution waiver that prevents you from suing them when they ask you to lie on your time card each week. You probably won't get to work during the last 2 weeks of December b/c of their shutdown period, which means red badges don't get paid. No agency provides PTO or sick time, their 401Ks and medical benefits are horrible horrible -- be careful what you accept, you will be sorry you didn't ask for a lot more on your hourly contract if you don't consider these things ahead of time. Every tool, ticketing system, support team, account team, technical team you work with will be excessively difficult, broken and unwilling to change. They prey on the young/recent grads and people new to IT. They are stuck in the 90s on pay and have the highest turnover rate I have ever seen. I watched over 30 people either quit, get laid off, or let go in just 12 months.

Advice to Senior Management
Management changes so often it won't matter. This company is living off their past and their big contracts from big fish companies who are run much in the same way who simply can't un-hook from the chains of their past Cisco investment (for now). How about take a long look at all the PMs, engagement managers, delivery managers and other people who can't even spell a single technical word -- who work remotely almost 100% of the time, yet produce nothing for the teams they supposedly represent. I know first hand many who play video games all day at home, forward a couple of emails and call it a day. Must be nice. Meanwhile those of us who have engineering degrees, certifications and over 20 years experience are dumped on all hours of the day, night, weekends and don't get anything in return for it. Once again, people with no technical skills who try to dress nice, use MBA jargon are running something that used to be great (because of R&D/technology -- you know, actually PRODUCING something of value instead of putting lip stick on a pig) right in to the ground. But fear not, Cisco will just do mass layoffs once or twice a year to try to hide the reality of this once great company now sinking away. Go white box networking startups! Put the nail in this now IBM-like company so technology can actually move forward again.

Pros
For a public giant, Cisco makes a noble effort to stay current with industry standards and best practices with its team org and culture. Mature company with a healthy drive among its senior-level leadership to run with the kids.

Cons
Changes can still be a bit slow within the massive machine. Lots of established processes and playbooks, so coloring outside lines can be at own risk ( not to say you can't, just do so with aware caution ).

Advice to Senior Management
Don't buy to kill competition but maybe take a lesson from the Starbucks / La Boulange transaction and try to merge and coexist or spin back out for happier resolution.

You need to fix the expense and procurement processes. This is a great example of processes that are over engineered and cumbersome. Everyone hates the processes and it often takes months . urghh!!!!

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer Director (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 9 Mar 2016

Pros
I joined Cisco in 1995 and left in 2014. The company I joined was not the company I left. The culture of family existed in the 1990's and early 2000's. The products, technologies, and people were fantastic and still are very good.

Cons
Cisco now does what large companies do, which is annual layoffs. Sometimes these layoffs are actually ongoing just aren't reported as they are below 3% of the total employee population. This systemic issue leads to a culture of CYA and backstabbing, especially at executive levels.

Advice to Senior Management
Bring the original values back to life. Treat all employees as family and focus on performance vs style...aka managing up rather than leading the team and business.

Advice to Senior Management
I am too naïve to advice anything to the management as of yet. I guess working for a few more months might help me provide useful insights for the company.

Pros
Good environment, friendly team. Pay is ok with bonus and ESPP.

Cons
If you don't know somebody from the management team, be aware. You will be kicked out and after 6 months they will hire you back as a contractor since the ones who are friends with the management team stayed but can not do anything... They will cut your pay to 40% or more without any benefit and you will do the job to cover for those mentioned above...

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer II (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 7 Mar 2016

Pros
Flexible work hours Process driven Employee oriented policies Work anywhere in the campus Obviously, this is applicable for employees working as Cessna.

Cons
Slide in the personal growth - Easy to climb two or three steps up the ladder, but after that it is all downhill. One constantly needs to indulge in stuff other than work to go up the ladder faster than others. Less hike - If not for promotion, the yearly hike is pretty less. The management does not listen to the employee qualms and queries. Often I kept hearing that only when you put your papers down, they will listen to you And these things are also not for employees working in Cessna, this is part and parcel of people working at RMZ Ecospace

Advice to Senior Management
Please heed to the employees' qualms and concerns, they are the building blocks after all. It is not as much as about the hike as it is about the appreciation and recognition some times.

Pros
This is the perfect work environment for someone who doesn't want to be challenged or noticed, and just wants to show up for a 9-5 job and get paid.

Cons
- Way past any exciting work left to do. - Packed with older people with old-school work habits (complete opposite of a startup) - No growth/challenges

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Sun, 6 Mar 2016

Pros
Diverse opportunities -supports career moves across functional silos Competitive compensation and benefits Good people - little to no tolerance for empire builders and leadership by fear Collaboration culture - supports flexible working, virtual collaboration, etc

Cons
Big company - takes a while for anyone to connect all the dots. You will likely find people in different organizations trying to achieve the same goal not knowing about each other Work hours - global company means working across time zones, partly compensated by flexible working, but if you need a 9-5 job this may not be for you.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep doing what you are doing - but need to emphasize e2e vision more, and put more investment into the future of the company, even if it means diverting investment from the "good enough" legacy business

From Cisco Systems Senior Project Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sun, 6 Mar 2016

Pros
Work from home Good health care option Short term disability pays 100% with 3 month job protection End of year shutdown requires Christmas and New Years off Work with some bright people Little travel for most projects

Cons
-Long hours depending on client -If you are good, they will often require you to work as a program manager with no promotion or salary increase -RSU are seldom given expect to top 5% with a subjective selection process -Internal movement is difficult - directors don't want to lose headcount so they often hire externally or utilize contractors which does not promote career growth -New CEO replaces ~75% of senior leadership which has resulted in a FY16 being a year of transition where middle management and those below are not informed of the direction of the company - are we a product company? Are we a software company? Are we a solutions company? -Cisco promotes the IoT World a Forum which relies on "things" needing to be connected yet executive management says we are not a solutions integrator....makes little sense. -Yearly restructuring and workforce reductions make It difficult to have any company loyalty or have insight into the direction of company - a company that constantly restructures, yearly, is a company unsure of its direction. -Unless you work out of one of the large offices (San Jose, Boxborough, RTP, or Richardson), executive management will not get to know you and you are excluded from doing any team building. I've worked on the same team for 4 years and never met any of my teammates or boss. -Salary is 15-20% below the market average. Pay raises are seldom given. - All this for a company with a world class brand and not knowing if you will be affected every year by the restructure or layoffs. - Internal back office systems are horrible for a "leading" IT company. They are beginning to get better, but back office work accounts for 30% of your time when it should be spent taking care of customers. They are constantly changing the systems we use.

Advice to Senior Management
Reverse the cons listed above. Care about all your people and they will move mountains for you. Don't neglect the majority of talent that work from home.

Cisco UCS group was a great group. Loved working there. High energy tremendous learning, great reach to customers, and very product focus. Tough management team, but enjoyed working for them, because they got stuff done.

Cisco is not a single company. Each BU can give different experiences. So need to figure out more about the team, management and product lifecycle before jumping in.

Advice to Senior Management
I don't know if it is possible, but need to work on harmonizing the Cisco experience across the company.

Cisco offers great package. The salary is the highest in the industry. Work environment is one of the best of all tech companies.

Cons
There is nothing really I come up with. Maybe the pressure you feel when you are under performing. but Cisco provides with all necessary tools for you to succeed.

Advice to Senior Management
Maybe a little bit too number oriented. too much focus on numbers in short-term. need to strategically execute operation with mid/long-term vision.

Pros
decent salary, good brand name, great on resume.

Cons
ucs group has tight schedule and high turnover rate, those who stay long at the group as a result suffers and overworks. the manager has no concept of advising and promoting employess that is long forgotten. management will listen but whatever told em will come-in in one ear and comes-out the other ear. Each project comes with a unbelievably tight deadline and either project slip is common or deliver with questionable quality. Too many ignorant, dont care engineers with great job title but lost a common sense. Some engineers can not even configure basic networking and incapable of communicating in simple english language. As a result of all these mishap, technical clarity, know-how suffered and confusion, bias and complacency prevailed.

Advice to Senior Management
Hire more and quality engineers instead of engineers-would-be who stays on the job 1-2 years and leave everything in mess.

* The pay is above the average comparing with other R&D center of similar size foreign companies in China. * Unlike most other Chinese companies, overtime work is not common. * It is a pleasure to work with professional colleagues. * Managers are supportive.

Cons
* Strict with travel cost. Used collaboration tools heavily to avoid traveling. * No travel allowance if travel abroad. Just cover all the actual cost of accommodation, dinner and transportation. * Career opportunity for software QA engineers is not as good as software engineers.

Advice to Senior Management
* Be more realistic with transitioning from waterfall development process to agile process. The best practices of other companies do not always apply to this company. Listen more to first line engineers about how to work in the agile way that fit them the best.

Pros
Generally speaking, perks and benefits are strong, though Webex/Collaboration business unit underpays relative to other business units.

Cons
Rapid management turnover while there. Consultants running amok. Company was looking to deep dive into their customer usage data to pull out lots of insights. Probably a privacy concern for companies that use Webex for sensitive meetings...

Advice to Senior Management
Hire nice people. Retain nice people. Don't rely on contractors and consultants to run your business or develop your product. Treat your customers right. Don't abuse their trust.

Pros
Good work life balance. Allow you to work remotely

Cons
I joined with a good salary 5 years ago as a new grad out of college, and I have seen only ONE increment of 5% in the last 5 years. It was not like I was not doing good. They kept doing re-orgs and rotated me under different managers. Each manager said I needed to establish myself with him. And each one promised me a promotion next year which didnt happen. I saw other people in other groups getting promoted or salary hiked much faster and here I am slogging under one manager after another, sometimes doing junk work that the technical leads themselves do not want to take. I stayed on because they gave me flexibility to work from home which I needed as I was facing some family issues. I looked outside and landed up with an offer that directly gave me a 45% hike. Happy to get out of here finally! I would not advise young people to join Cisco unless they know they are getting the right pay, the right recognition and growth in their careers. Each group is different, not every group need to be like mine. But move out as soon as you find out you are stagnating or you are not being just-fully rewarded/promoted, within 6 months.

Advice to Senior Management
Please do not do ratings based on the peers in the same grade, but based on individual's performance and what is needed for that project. Promotions and salary hikes become too political, especially when you are under a new manager vs a seasoned manager who might have a good rapport with the director.

Pros

Advice to Senior Management
To the first level managers i advice them that they have to be more part of the business not only to be resource manager.

From Cisco Systems Sales Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 1 Mar 2016

Pros
Cisco is a good remunerating company which allow you to grow a lot. If you are a curious guy this company provide you internal and external training, access to a big database of technical resources, access to research companies reports, a really powerful community to rely on, Benefits and pay are above the average. Knowledge is well spread around the company.

Cons
Employment selection is hard. Sometime the glory doesn't go to the guy who did the job. This company will never manage a pension application. A sales force renewal process is always ongoing.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer II (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Mon, 29 Feb 2016

Pros
Good work life balances in case placed in good team. Earlier, used to be good organization with lot of WFH benefits and good technical career. But now a days some Leads/Managers are not allowing WFH due to work pressure where there is challenge to hire new resources. Good brand. Also, not allowing remote workers now a days for many teams. Taking leaves also challenge in some teams.

Cons
Nowadays after Chuck Robbins taken charge most BU's/teams has went with reorg and lost many c-workers due to same. I was waiting to be converted for more then 1 and half year but never got converted as team was running on limited budget. FYI, contract jobs are first hit in these re-orgs, it happened almost every quarter of 2015 and 2016. In San Francisco complete floor was removed, i guess 500 folks. In Bangalore in our team itself 7-10 people got removed. It has crazy hire and fire policy. Also, for c workers there is no future plan for long term career for many managers, they just hire to do daily tasks as such. They will promise to convert after 6 months or so but they will postpone it like any number of years. I have seen people working c worker for more then 8 years who got survived enough.

Advice to Senior Management
You need to financial supports teams in order to grow in technical front or innovation. Moving innovation in IOT doesnt means you need to rem voe c-workers at all other teams and BUs. Also, pls have some plan to hire c worker in short term if they are working good for you.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 26 Feb 2016

Pros
Lots of new things to learn. If you like to learn, cisco would be good place for you. Great people and culture.

Cons
Office politics. You won't get any other internal promotion email if you are just good at your job and role. Still there are many rubbish managers who lead their team to rubbish. Need luck not to meet those managers.

Advice to Senior Management
Please focus on the business and jobs.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 26 Feb 2016

Pros
Great Pay, Industry leader, great benefits, great autonomy and world class people...you are working with the key people in the industry....you are a leader...you are driven and love it....plenty of off sites, volunteer events....you will learn more and drive major initiatives...a truly great job..

Cons
Be careful of believing in your own propaganda. they boast of the business unit and then lay off 40%....there are great leaders...and there are weak ones...and the weak ones will do anything to stay on...and they will ask for your thoughts...but really do not want them...agree with them or leave. This company will reorg and layoff every quarter...and then hire on new grads to replace the seniors....a great experience comes with severe issues. I saw the best mangers...and the worst at one company--and there is a bit of a loyalty issues from those managers.

Advice to Senior Management
you have created a great company....and lay off the seniors who stay on...

The only suggestion I can think of is to work some sort standardized training program into new hire positions. Seemed to be some inconsistency.

Pros
* infrastructure is good enough * internet reimbursement every month

Cons
* Cisco is a type of company where a potentially healthy guy can try to physically dominate a girl & misbehave in front of 100+ people, but asking for apology via mail will demotivate him!! * no actual use of brain to solve the problems, only copy pasting of code * does not care for employees * no improvement in knowledge of employee * lot of dirty politics for promotions & appreciation

Advice to Senior Management
no comments for management.

Pros
Good work, IEEE standard setting groups, lots of different work opportunities and groups. Company pays for a lot of training (courses at Berkeley or Stanford are free if you get at least a B)

Cons
Company mood highly correlated with stock price. Your experience depends on the group that you are in. Cisco is really 20 different companies joined as one.

Advice to Senior Management
Management turns over way too quickly so reorgs are always happening. Just having stable management is a good plus

Pros
Die Kultur bei Cisco ist vorbildlich und auch Verdienstmoeglichkeiten sind sehr gut. Ausserdem ist Cisco mit seinem gesamten Produktpotfolio in den Bereichen Netzwerk, Security und Data Center sehr gut aufgestellt.

Cons
Leider sehr viel Administration mit vielen Prozessen und Tools. Auch ist das Arbeitspensum relativ hoch.

Advice to Senior Management
Das Management sollte den Account Managern durch eine Inside Sales Unterstuetzung oder andere Massnahmen den Ruecken freihalten, so dass diese mehr Zeit fuer den eigentlichen Vertrieb beim Kunden haben.

From Cisco Systems Senior Software QA Engineer (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 24 Feb 2016

Pros
Cisco is a nice place to work for the most part. It really depends on the group that you are. Some BU's people work like crazy and products have huge revenue. "you want to be in one of these BU's". If the BU you are working has little or low growth forget about any career advancements or innovations. Compensation is fairly OK

Cons
If you are in a stable BU, not much happens and if you are not careful you will end up doing the same tasks everyday. After 5 years working for Cisco everyone outside of this company will be reluctant to wire you. Compensation is almost direct of how many years you are in Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Do not keep engineers doing the same jobs without innovating all the time. Cisco engineers after 10 years working there are really out of touch with the Market.

Cons
Lots of execution difficulty if you're in the wrong market

Advice to Senior Management
Need to fully plan GTM strategy before trying to execute. Most of the problems at Cisco are the SLT wanting to build products and the execution is not thought out an there are so many "uh oh" moments and then they backtrack or panic and have to put out fires to the product development, pricing and sales teams.

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 23 Feb 2016

Pros
Great Work/Life balance; great work from home option; great at-home communication equipment; good benefits and ESPP program; good overall compensation and generally good people, especially the newer folks; Cisco is still a great resume builder

Cons
Cisco is a huge company, so your experience will vary depending on your team and your position; Some departments & managers are great and you'll love your time there, but with the constant change and restructuring there's a good chance you'll be shuttled to different teams and management; Internal movement is difficult unless you're in the cliques; The culture and climate deteriorated during my tenure; Employees at the larger campuses seem to have better experiences; Some managers are only interested in managing up and not managing their teams; The stereotype of Cisco SEs and AMs being arrogant still holds true for a lot of the old guard

Advice to Senior Management
Speed the adoption of cloud services and MSP models to stay relevant. And stop the yearly August Shuffle of departments. It's still a great company with great products, technology and market share, but don't rest on your past successes and don't get caught napping.

Advice to Senior Management
Ask more question if you don't understand a project or reason behind an issue, Focus on your function and allow the people assigned to certain tasks to perform their function, and again, ask if you are unclear about anything

From Cisco Systems Project Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Tue, 23 Feb 2016

Pros
Cool events weekly pop up parties generous snacks and food perks. Huge Work-life balance, sometimes is can be a bad thing with too much time in your hands Managers are awesome even functional non-direct reports.

Cons
...On a higher level management side of engineering (I'm sure in different organizations as well) there is unethical and illegal practices being done. Why is nothing being done you ask? Well look at the diversity and you probably won't be shocked at who protects who in this organization, there is plenty of people waiting in line to take your job.

Advice to Senior Management
Fix the corruption in the engineering org

Pros
Can still be a solid company if management got their act together. Also don't know how to maintain talent and keep motivated. Lot of duplicate roles

Cons
Too much cross functional leadership. Hard to tell who is leading the company at times. Some areas are just a mess due to constant transitions.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on execution and hold leaders responsible not solely on obtainment of number but also how much of a disaster they create

From Cisco Systems Senior Software Engineer (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Mon, 22 Feb 2016

Pros
Nice perks. Everyone gets access to the fitness center and issued this nice towel. Shame you're not in a frame of mind to USE them unless you're in the right groups. There's no cafeteria One of the buildings had one they shuttered- but they have this nifty self-serve convenience store stuffed in part of where they had the caf. Debit card only. Security monitoring since you're not on an honor system with it.

Cons
Pros end with what I describe. Management's clearly lost, with nobody sound at the helm. The mass layoffs you hear about are partly due to their insistence on being multicultural, partly because many of the people involved with anything other than their original core businesses, switching and routing, have this disturbing and shocking lack of understanding of general networking, IP networking, or the like. They're "good" with things like 802.11 OTA/OTW frames, but behaviors due to spanning tree and the like? Forget it. And it shows. Look at the reviews of their WAP371AK9 1200AC AP. If you're doing something simple, it works reasonably well. Try to use the claimed features? Whooo... Simply put, if you're in anything other than the Unified Communications or Switching and Routing BU's, you're in for a trip into hell and they have as high as a 10% attrition rate from regular *ANNUAL* RIFs. Worse, you have to scrape and scrounge for almost ALL hardware you need to do your job, including the PC's. NOT what I would consider to be a good thing with a company such as Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Surgically remove your heads from your backsides. Your name is about to quit carrying you forward and you're going to flush the company down the crapper. Meraki's being treated as "GOD, come down to earth" and they only do "well" in mesh WiFi work from the spun off RoofNet project (which, by the by, any fool can turn around and obtain that code core from MIT...)- they *DO NOT* have the answers regarding much of anything else and unifying the codebases...heh... GUT your Wireless BU and START OVER.

Pros
Worked for Cisco Chennai which is very different from Cisco Bangalore in terms of culture and openness but had a chance to do some really interesting technical stuff

Cons
Favoritism was a big problem which will be evident even in events like Hackathon, only the chosen ones always get recognition no matter how naive their idea is

Advice to Senior Management
Please treat talent equally though your trust lies with only few people, this will create a competitive environment so even your favorite ones get challenged for company's good

Pros
Cisco has an excellent intern program. If you got the job, the best parts are about to begin. Find a mentor, network and be responsive.

Cons
Not the most challenging projects are given to interns as it depends on the needs of manager and also the duration. So you might not necessarily get what your interested in.

From Cisco Systems Marketing Professional (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 19 Feb 2016

Pros
Cisco offers a comparatively stable work environment with some very talented folks. There is a strong customer-oriented point of view across the company which has held up over the years.

Cons
Cisco is a huge, incredibly profitable firm facing competitive forces from powerful new adversaries attacking from market perspectives never seen before. That evolved landscape is leading to uncertainty, which is in turn leading to variability in the way the company is managed.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't mistake swift, assertive action for intelligent management practice.

Pros
Flexible working location and schedule for a lot of roles. Some people are awesome. Genuinely tryng to improve the employee experience. Great leadership in IT at the moment (Diaz).

From Cisco Systems Project Manager (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Fri, 19 Feb 2016

Pros
Amazing people, tightly focused on delivery of best products to fit the needs of our clients.

Cons
Long hours, often weekends, with a lot of stress from the clients to achieve their goals. Often working with clients who were not fully educated with the strengths of the systems. The pressure was to "Get it now exactly like it used to be" rather then taking the time to Do what is Best. As some jobs grew more complex, the pressures increased.

Advice to Senior Management
Be patient with the people you have. And make better use of your In Country resources, rather then depending on Out of Theater resources.

Cisco Systems has the Best Work Life Balance. Thanks to it's own products and engineering, the company also facilitates a great working atmosphere wherein connecting from any location is EASY!

It's a top heavy organization and that may make sense because of the employee strength, but because of so many leaders within the organization, there is a lot of movement and direction without focus on 1 vision.

Pros
People. Values. Culture. Top. This are the 4 keywords I want to use to describe Cisco. All the people I've ever met at Cisco are awesome. The company culture is very strong for a company that grew so much in so little time. Every single Cisco person is willing to help you and, if they can't, they always redirect you to someone who might have the solution of your problem. Cisco is top, market leader, it gives you the access to the latest technologies and the opportunity to develop you career path both vertically and horizontally.

Cons
Sometimes you get lost in the corporate governance chain. Cisco can be a complex machine sometimes and you can forget for whom you are actually working for. Home office plays a very important role in Cisco, which is awesome. Nevertheless, virtual teams have their own pros and cons, but without the proper management downsides can easily take over the benefits of VT.

Advice to Senior Management
Micromanage less. Give straight answers in response to straight questions. Sometimes guide more your employees. In Cisco every person is captain of his/her own career, no manager will ever tell you what to do. Though, sometimes people need being told what to do or what would be best for them.

From Cisco Systems Program Manager IV (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 4 of 4 found this helpful — Sat, 13 Feb 2016

Pros
I worked at the company for fourteen years, starting as an intern. I must admit the first half of my time there was great, and Cisco had many lateral opportunities in San Jose to try new things. I was proud to work at Cisco, and it was a name that was respected world-wide.

Cons
Outside of the business units, operations jobs in both software and hardware were a living hell. My specialty became training and moving jobs overseas, saving money that was enjoyed at higher levels. Working with and in other time zones was required, and I worked with India, Europe, Asia, and Mexico. Travel was usually reasonable but not at the end. When our team was identified to be off-shored, management was ruthless. Those who weren't let go in the beginning were tortured in my opinion. Some were moved into roles requiring 50% travel. I tried to lateral out of such a role and was told by the senior director that they were looking at moving a younger person in the role I wanted. Rather than letting them torture me further and then lay me off when I was done moving my career path off-shore, I quit and found a better paying job elsewhere. I literally could not believe how they repaid service and loyalty at the end.

Advice to Senior Management
Break up the cliques. Fire directors with few or zero reports. Be a leader on reasonable executive compensation. Find ways to keep jobs in the USA

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sat, 13 Feb 2016

Pros
I had enjoyed working with Cisco and the teams. It was rewarding journey from learning and career perspective. I liked the company in many aspects: great culture, transparent communications from executives, ethical, collaborative and inclusive working environment and superb talents community. If you show good potential, are passionate to take bigger responsibility and take initiative to advance career, I have found management is always willing to provide mentoring and coaching and development opportunities. I also felt proud about the fact that the company put lots of efforts in social responsibility.

Cons
I generally worked long hours and sometimes stayed up late to get connected with team from other countries. Headquarter centric, there were moments that regional team needed to fight for decision making.

From Cisco Systems New Product Project Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 12 Feb 2016

Pros
A solid company that overall treats its employees well. Good benefits, with ability to work from home every now and then. A lot of smart and talented people, both in Development and in Supply Chain organizations. Lots of challenging and interesting projects. Employee recognition methods are changing for the better.

Cons
For a new product that has not yet "proven" itself in the market, resources are often minimal, so people get spread pretty thin. The hours can get long for long stretches of time. The top management can sporadically change direction, and years' worth of work can go down the drain. Cost-cutting has led to a lot of churn with contractors and off-shoring.

Advice to Senior Management
Those "start-up" BUs would work out better if you fund them properly and have the strength of conviction to see them through. Disruption for the sake of disruption is not a good idea.

From Cisco Systems Senior User Experience Designer (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — 7 of 7 found this helpful — Fri, 12 Feb 2016

Pros
Great work life balance. Work from home is a major plus (they own WebEx). Smart capable people. Amazing benefits including a full week of paid leave for charity volunteering. Love how much the company gives back to society.

Cons
Very rare to get a salary increase, so be sure you're OK with the salary you accept. Lots of churn in mid-management, I've had 13 managers in seven years. Tough to get your ideas heard, unless you're politically minded. Since the company is so large, there are a lot of slackers who coast along just under the radar, which can be de-motivating. Very engineering driven with design, and user experience, as an afterthought. There is also no clear career path for designers. Design is not handled in a traditional manner, so collaborating with fellow designers is rare- instead you're assigned a product and become silo'ed in it.

Advice to Senior Management
Implement a more detailed review of managers, and management, by their staff- in an anonymous method so that real feedback can be delivered and received. Current "Pulse" surveys are lame in that they are so high-level they fail to be actionable. Also, if you intend on continuing to talk about how important user experience design is to the company, you should update your human resources systems to include the job title "user experience designer" and "designer". Instead, we are all labeled engineers, which is not accurate and is somewhat insulting.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Fri, 12 Feb 2016

Pros
Culture is strong - if not Darwinian

Cons
When i was there Cisco had yet to bring on Chuck Robbins as CEO. Chambers was inspirational & aspirational - but im afraid technology and the global economy was too slippery for his grasp. Robbins has no less a challenge. A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.

Pros
A great, established company in an amazing area. Great Facilities. Very Helpful superiors

Cons
Blind sided by the lack of job offer. A lot of frustrations with getting help from IT. Too much office space.

Advice to Senior Management
Be more transparent about opinion of interns. Seemed like they were going to hire most of us from the beginning of the program, and it seems like very few got offers, despite rave reviews from managers.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Network Consulting Engineer says "Limited Restructuring"

From Cisco Systems Network Consulting Engineer (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Thu, 11 Feb 2016

Pros
Relentless sales machine with a no lose attitude.

Cons
No where near the same company I started with 16 years ago and not moving nearly quick enough to keep up with the competition. Limited Restructuring (fancy name for layoffs) now a quarterly event. Many of us who brought in millions for the company have left or been forced out when a theater goes through a down cycle. BU's are not consistently held accountable for failure to deliver on commitments and staying competitive.

Advice to Senior Management
Look harder at your talent going out the door. You may be able to hire younger staff for half the cost but you cannot replace veterans with years of experience in this industry nor replace the long term customer relationships that are lost. Come up with a better internal placement program.

Very flexible environment and you can work remotely which is great. Never had a bad manager and the culture is very strong.

Pros
Excellent infrastructure. One of the best in BLR. Strong talent pool - both technical and leadership. Vast opportunity as virtually every business function and every technology is represented in Cisco India.

Cons
Yearly layoffs, feeling that one is playing a survival game and competing with one's peers. Compensation could be better...

Advice to Senior Management
Promote talent and potential, not loyalty and experience. Time in Grade is important but should not be used to eliminate candidates who are already performing at the next level.

Pros
Was an Intern. Good Events Good managers Good Teammates. Enjoyed the experience, conversion to full time should not be very tough if you show potential.

Cons
Company is in a transition. Takes some time getting used to the internal platforms and softwares. But is a good experience in general. Need to find referrals to get interview calls I feel. Feels bureaucratic at times.

Advice to Senior Management
I feel the company would do better if there were more younger people and also women. I feel they would bring in fresh ideas and different perspectives which combined with experienced employees would yield a lot of good things.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems User Experience Designer says "Where great people go to retire into mediocrity"

From Cisco Systems User Experience Designer (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 5 Feb 2016

Pros
I moved between a couple of teams during my time at Cisco. I guess that's a pro that you can do that. Cisco has the resources to hire excellent people. I never lacked for anything. Vacation allowances were pretty good, healthcare was convenient. Always more work to be done than people to do it, but never felt too overloaded in the long run.

Cons
Cisco in general does not like to fire or otherwise diminish the effects of poor performers. Combined with bureaucracy, you get folks in formal or informal leadership positions who've been around for a long time but who aren't actually up to par with new tech/methods/advancements. On two of my teams, the 'bad egg' was the manager--one was actually eventually laid off/let go after most of the team had already quit or moved to another team, another used the team as a front/stepping stone to further their own advancement... and advanced (unfortunately for the company, I think). On the last team, everyone both excellent and mediocre had gotten so used to the overall mediocrity that I was terrified of slipping into the same cadence as the rest so I left. It wasn't the worst, but you have to be ready to accept the clocked-out-while-you're-clocked-in life, and while I think that's actually an ok choice, I didn't want it. While benefits were good, compensation was pretty lacking.

Advice to Senior Management
I don't know. I understand why everything is so slow and difficult and bureaucratic so I don't blame anyone. It's just that there's so much that could have been prevented/accomplished by removing a few key individuals who bring down the team.

Pros
Lots of great people. Cisco products and solutions are in just about every company and government in the world! Get to work in so many areas of tech and see things sometimes years before end customers. Can have a huge impact for good on many people because Cisco is so far reaching and IP networks plus communications are so critical to modern life. Because they make all the tools and solutions to enable telecommuting, you can work from just about anywhere just as effectively as being in a traditional office.

Cons
Has become very corporate. Too many blazers are being worn. Needs to get focus and priority back on engineers, creatives, and makers to compete in the very fast paced tech world. Has cut cut cut away all the little perks that used to help define the culture. Too many lay offs which are killing morale and loyalty.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't let Cisco become another HP or IBM. Ditch the blazers and be tech execs. Hire more experienced engineers and makers to leadership positions.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Thu, 4 Feb 2016

Pros
Lots of flexibility, was able to telecommute and work part time for a couple of years. Way back when, most everyone got stock options and felt ownership. That's not a pro anymore.

Cons
The process people took over. Sometimes we had to change perfectly functional code to satisfy a tool that identified a possible problem, even if we could prove it couldn't happen. Too much focus on reducing headcount rather than retaining and motivating good performers.

Advice to Senior Management
Find a way to bring back the entrepreneurial attitude Cisco used to have. Cut the layers of VPs that just get in the way. Reward managers for getting things done rather than cutting headcount.

Pros
Cisco is a giant and a brand people trust. For good reason they make some of the best network related products on the market. Customers pick up the phone when they hear your from Cisco.

Cons
Cisco has lost its way in terms of their sales efforts. They have become so effective at marketing to themselves they've lost perspective on the world around them. They're so focused on selling for the now they frustrate customers of the long term relationship.

Advice to Senior Management
Slow down and look at building long lasting relationships rather than the immediate sale.

Pros
Flexible working hours , chance to grow in the industry , good name on your resume

Cons
A toxic work environment built on perceived visibility and contributions rather than recognising individuals for what they really are contributing. This promotes a culture of pretending to work rather than really working. Too many mid level manager , most have nothing to do and abuse corporate travel and expensess.

Advice to Senior Management
Go back to being an engineering company , change the toxic culture you'be cultivated over the years and make HR be more useful than just processing hire and fire forms.

Pros
Amazing place to work.. loads of fun, you can do whatever you want depending on your manager.

Cons
Salary is not that competitive, thats the reason not many fresh graduates join the company and everyone says Cisco is the one to get settled with and not start with, but it actually depends on the team you are getting in,

Advice to Senior Management
Encourage fresh graduates, provide them the work they want. Polish them, also please increase the pay.

Pros
Hardworking "what can I do to help" culture. Good benefits. Good HR systems in place for the most part. Security is proving to be model for structure.

Cons
Ongoing restructuring approach. Few people in office breeds isolation. Sr. Management is getting increasingly political.

Advice to Senior Management
Find a way to stop layoffs from continually hang over employees. Puts everything on hold and saps enthusiasm. Hard to promote genuine people deal without transparent plan for addressing. Pick a direction and stick to it rather than shifting every year.

From Cisco Systems Product Sales Specialist (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 2 Feb 2016

Pros
company isn't going anywhere, has a great opportunity if it executed on all ideas, telecommuting

Cons
small players eat Cisco's lunch at will. Losing marketshare, stock plummeting, revolving door with guaranteed annual layoffs and "limited restructuring" mid year pretty much every year. Work can certainly carve into personal time.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep your employees and allow lateral movement if need be if the company is venturing into new territories. Stop firing people all the time.

From Cisco Systems Product Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 2 Feb 2016

Pros
Great work/life balance; chill place to work; can work from home due to telecommuting technology; independence in directing your career.

Cons
Very political; you'll have to learn how to use political skills to get things done; not a lot of data-driven emphasis regarding decision-making; "socializing" ideas is very important. Slow in making decisions and executing.

Advice to Senior Management
If you want to recruit young talent, you'll have to create an environment where young and talented people can thrive, rather than political.

From Cisco Systems Marketing (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 2 Feb 2016

Pros
Generally speaking people at Cisco are nice and respectful, especially compared to other high-tech companies where I've worked. They encourage and enable job and even entire career changes within the company, so there are lots of people who have been there 10+ years (which is a pro and a con actually). From my experience elsewhere I find they pay well, especially at the more junior levels, and the bonuses have been pretty healthy. Chuck is one of the most sincere CEO's in the Valley and deeply cares about doing good as a company.

Cons
The company is going through lots of change right now with an almost entirely new exec leadership team. They seem to be finding it hard to make decisions so important things seem to be stalled (especially in marketing). Chuck says he wants to move fast and faster yet, but we seem to be moving so sloooooooowly. It's excruciating. They also are pretty open about wanting to get rid of people at the more senior levels to bring in lots of young employees. And they want to reduce hiring in San Jose in favor of less expensive locations. So job security for senior people in San Jose is dicey. And finally, they're trying really hard to be cool and hip to bring in those younger people, but it verges on embarrassing how they go about it. Wearing jeans and doing video profiles called "meet our millennials" doesn't do it. It's well intended though!

Advice to Senior Management
Consider settling down all of the re-organizing and layoffs for awhile so work can actually get done. Some execs need to stop trying to consensus build and impress their peers and start making decisions.

From Cisco Systems Data Center Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 2 Feb 2016

Pros
Most intelligent and social professionals you will ever meet. Learned the most I've ever learned at an internship. Everything you learn is so applicable to any career path (how the internet works, OS, basic coding, troubleshooting, etc.)

Cons
As a data center engineer, you're reliant on people telling you what to do. Sometimes you're sitting there with your feet up. Other times theres you have five top priority tasks to complete at once. Very chaotic nature at times.

Advice to Senior Management
Understand the crazy nature of working in a data center and give those team members a heads up of big upcoming tasks.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Director says "A great company where change truly is the only constant"

From Cisco Systems Director (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 2 Feb 2016

Pros
Clear vision and strategy supported by strong leadership with the ability to execute. Constant innovation across a broad portfolio of solutions, services and go-to-market strategy. Excellent colleagues with high standards of performance and integrity - and the ability to have fun - several have become personal friends. Flexibility in terms of work life balance and leveraging technology to work wherever you are.

Cons
High performance culture with freedom and flexibility may also lead to a 24x7 working schedule, so it requires a level of maturity from each individual, and a clear line of communication with your immediate manager, to ensure that the ability to work anywhere/anytime does not consume you.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep hiring and developing top talent with a view to balancing out the workforce. My personal experience was that Cisco is extremely well run. Make sure that the level of professionalism does not kill the passion and enthusiasm around "changing the way we work, live, play and learn". Continue to invest in managers to develop their people skills - not just their core skills.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Human Resources Manager says "Reinventing how we work.....it is real at Cisco"

From Cisco Systems Human Resources Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 1 Feb 2016

Pros
Cisco is capturing the transition of the changing work place and workforce. Never in my career have I been a part of a company that has been able to capture the market transition with a view and ability to translate the change and impact on everyday work for employees. The concept of digitization and automation is real. I am watching groups like Supply Chain and HR open the gates to their employees to rethink how work is done. They are not asking people managers or senior leaders to do this - they are asking employees. The are looking at full day experiences to break old processes and use new tools to re-invent work. We are telling Cisco how to work differently, using the tools and best practices that we see. We will learn together. We get to take simplification and speed to another level. Every demographic in the workplace can join in to reboot work. In this digital world the walls must come down, employees must work together to solve problems, motivate each other and bring in the talent to continue the wave. It is real - Cisco is doing it! We are connecting everything, benefiting everyone and innovating everywhere! The culture at Cisco is evolving...Human Resources is standing up in a bold way to be a driving force in how the company evolves. We all have to step into the conversation and be a part of this change. Relationships still matter but you also have to think differently - real time. Nothing remains the same....this is fantastic.

Cons
In order to be a part of the transition, you have to have time to think and solve the problems in a new way. We work hard and smart. In this time of change - you must do more. Work life integration is getting harder. So remember wherever you are, you must take time to reflect and rest, or you will not be able to see the changes you must make.

From Cisco Systems Sales (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 1 Feb 2016

Pros
I loved working for Cisco and recommend it to anyone. It is a fast paced environment but there are great products and great people to work with.

Cons
Every six months there is another restructuring and the people they are letting go are often some of the best performers. Cisco used to be one of the higher paying sales jobs you could get, but now the comp plans are hard to blow out and if you do, your number for the next year will make it difficult to repeat.

Advice to Senior Management
Every six months you put another batch of qualified people on the street, many of whom end up working for the competition. When the first big layoff hit several years back, it felt like the whole company was in agony. Now they happen and people don't seem to notice. The reason given is that Cisco is restructuring to better address the market and that may be true but reality is that reflect the short sightedness of management. Chuck Robbins should start thinking like the basketball player he was and get rid of coaches when they have a bad season, not the team.....

Not many subject matter experts and lots of things done in a very primitive fashion because management will not spend money to get things done. Executives seem to spend lavishly on themselves and seem overly compensated as individual contributors don't get so much as a cost of living raise and it is not uncommon for people to be at the same salary/grade level for years and years.

Advice to Senior Management
You won't keep any real talent with non-competitive salaries and lack of career progression for people who have less than 20 years at the company. Very unattractive for millenials and younger Gen-Xers who expect to be compensated and rewarded for the work they do as opposed to watching older Gen-Xers and Baby Boomers take all of the money and the credit.

Pros
Cisco is a very Good company to work for. Currently, it's transitioning to be a better company. Overall, the work environment is conducive.

Cons
I feel the working culture should be little better.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Sun, 31 Jan 2016

Pros
-Meet very intelligent people (to work with) -Super helpful environment -Amazing support system -Interesting projects -Fun outings for interns throughout the entire summer -Great place to work!

Cons
I don't really have any complaints about Cisco as an Intern. They have an amazing internship program that fosters a lot of growth.

Advice to Senior Management
One thing I would have liked to see is maybe give interns multiple projects to choose from, rather than get assigned to one automatically. But even without that suggestion, if the intern didn't like their project, they could easily switch to something else since the managers and employees are super flexible!

Pros
Good work life balance, get to work from home couple of days a week. People are easy to get along with.

Cons
Innovation is not recognized. Some one at the top takes the credit for innovation, lot of politics and nepotism.

Advice to Senior Management
Cut the dead wood at the top , it is rotting the tree. Some people just get promoted for doing POCs that go no where. It has become more about people promoting themselves than the company or product.

From Cisco Systems Program Manager (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Sat, 30 Jan 2016

Pros
Many Perks for "some" select positions. Nothing others do not offer. Work from home. Flexible hours but heavy load and long days. On campus medical and gyms now. On Campus cafeterias. A good manager is rare but if you end up with one they will let you guide your career. Employee stock purchase program.

Cons
Hostile work environment. Job Titles are diminished and not factual. As of 2015 reverting back to political structure of "good ole boys" network, VERY Political and NOT customer focused. Power hungry managers prefer to strip down the inside. Nortel Mentality has set in. Unable to execute any concepts advertised , smoke and mirrors. Focused on hiring Very low wage college graduates at sub par salaries- expect 30 to 40k less at Cisco. Inclusion and diversity is failing by taking unqualified employees and rising them to high pay , high ranking positions simply based on race and or sex. This is having a horrible impact on the customer and the business. If you like to keep the same salary forever, never move up , just lateral and you enjoy being stripped of your confidence, and you like to worry monthly about being laid off or fired then this is the gig for you! As of 2016 Cisco is failing hard. The new CEO is not business or tech, he is a ,math major. The original CEO still on the board runs the business via proxy. Cisco has had a history of success through acquisitions, that is why they are the Borg. This is failing now. Expect massive layoffs in FY16 and FY17 as they outsource more and cut staff. Internal training has dried up. The internal rating system is fixed and the employee has little if any say.

Advice to Senior Management
Wake up! There are serious internal problems that are starting to bleed out. These are having a direct impact on the business and the customer. Cisco does not just need technical innovation it needs leadership and a focus on services. The routing and switching market is dying, Hang on to that and become Nortel, Fix internal issues. Bring back a fair rating system. Cisco has positioned itself to strong arm the employee. Shameful

Pros
Great benefits. Good learning opportunities. Good company on resume. Good 401K and Health benefit.

Cons
The thought of frequent layoffs is crippling. Good performance doesn't prevent you from being considered for layoff.

Advice to Senior Management
Be mindful of the impacts of layoffs. It doesn't encourage innovation, employees just try to live to keep there jobs by pulling others down.

Pros
Allow employees to work from home. Very loose direct management styles allow a lot of creativity in our jobs.

Cons
High level management has no idea what their teams actually do. Severe disconnect between reality and working process. High stress levels at times and constant concern about job security. Long hours. Very little thought to work / life balance. If you don't work 100 hours a week, they will find someone less qualified who has no qualms about the hours.

Advice to Senior Management
Higher level management needs to spend time with the "boots on the ground" and understand what they do and how it's getting done. It's impossible to understand need when you don't understand process and what the teams are going through.

Pros
Cisco is literally the company that made the internet - so it has some smart people and a huge customer & partner base. Work culture varies from group to group so it is hard to characterize it any one way.

Cons
The culture for Cisco has changed significantly from the 90s when it was a technology company singularly looking to get more market share with a variety of different technologies. Now the culture is primarily focused on politics. This feedback is primarily focused at Services and the culture there. A lot of the management is not barely familiar with the technology. When they get barely familiar with the technology, they are playing catch with where the market direction may be headed. Then there is complete ignorance of where the industry is heading with technologies such Virtualization, Analytics and Services in general. Management rewards each other with pats on the back and results of Services performance is not reviewed and weighed as a metric for evaluation. WIth the result innovation is stiffled.

Advice to Senior Management
Look at performance of Cloud & Managed Services introduced and see whether you should be rewarding leaders who are bringing these services to market and investing in them.

Pros
great freedom to explore well-thought out new ideas

Cons
New LR methodology seems to be spreadsheet number-driven versus real-life success strategy planning driving and adapting experienced Cisco-ers to demonstrate success in the new IoT and ACI world!

Advice to Senior Management
Do not throw away great Cisco-experienced and trusted resources - learn to trust in the capability of your existing experienced employees! They always deliver! Othewise you have just short-term success, and long-term Customer Satisfaction. Reflect your customers' values - they go with their Employee Loyalty drivers and retain their experienced employees!

Pros
Cisco are a good company to work for. Like any company, your experience will depend on the team you are working with. There is plenty of opportunity to improve your skill-set.

Cons
People are afraid to share their knowledge, that it somehow blunts their edge. The whole career review process is managed by your line manager, so be wary.

Pros
Flexible working hours with great work-life balance Work from home option is one of the biggest facility this company provides and there is hardly any micro management

Cons
Hard to manage work life balance Very big company with constant changes

Advice to Senior Management
In my time at Cisco I was a part of 3 different and distinct business units. I enjoyed working for each of them and found that I was able to contribute value in every role I held. What was painfully obvious to me was that the company is (or was) going through a bit of an identity crisis. Consumer vs no consumer. Social media vs no social media. AWS like cloud offering vs Cisco cloud offering. My advice to the leadership team is this. We (Cisco for life) are *Cisco*. *We* develop the standard for networking, infrastructure and cloud.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 7 of 7 found this helpful — Wed, 27 Jan 2016

Pros
Have worked there for 10 years. Good pay and benefits. Lots of good people to work with. The best thing I have enjoyed is the flexibility, i.e. the ability to work remotely, flexible schedule.

Cons
- You can move laterally as much as you want but upward progression can be very difficult. Making it past Grade 11 and 12 seem to be very political. - Cisco relies on its bonus structure for retention. They do not give annual pay increases. I came in at a good rate and sat at that rate for 7 years before getting a raise. Negotiate a good salary coming in the door because that's all you'll get for a while! - The company still goes through an annual layoff cycle. Good people with lots of years with the company are usually let go without the opportunity to find another position internally. This is starting to make a lot of people anxious. There is a big push to move US employees to their Raleigh NC (RTP) campus.

Advice to Senior Management
- provide more opportunities and transparency around upward/forward promotions vs. lateral moves

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Mon, 25 Jan 2016

Pros
Huge company means plenty of resources to set up meetings and conferences, and so on. Suppliers return your call every time. Corporate resources library on the intranet is unbelievably huge. Smaller divisions like cable BU do some interesting technical work.

Cons
The size of the company is so big that you rarely feel a sense of empowerment. In the grand scheme of things, your work hardly matters. Or so it feels like. Somewhere, 6 levels above you, some EVP makes decisions and sends you an email, mostly congratulating himself on what a wonderful email he has written. The new centralized organization chart makes things even worse than before.

Advice to Senior Management
Find meaningful ways to let employees control the outcome of the group. Let them make decisions.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Systems Engineer says "Great company, too much middle management"

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 25 Jan 2016

Pros
Access to some of the smartest people in the world, great salary, remote work culture, and great customers

Cons
Too much internal focus and time spent on "beauty pageants" where SEs are asked to present back to management. It's really a way to prove you're good at your job, but in my opinion a good manager should know without burning valuable time that should be spent focusing on customers.

Advice to Senior Management
Re-focus efforts on delivering the best products, services, architectures, and sales experience for customers. Cut out the internal BS, flatten the management structure, and the results will follow.

From Cisco Systems Virtual Operations (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Mon, 25 Jan 2016

Pros
Having a big name like Cisco on your resume was great. Helped me get my next position. The campus is great, 3 cafeterias, 4 basketball courts, tennis and sand volleyball. There is an onsite gym that is very nice.

Cons
Working as a contract employee you feel a little left out of the fold even though its about a 60/40 split. Cisco is about the bottom line and our jobs were transitioned overseas as soon as it was feasible (even after consistent discussions from management that that would not be the case).

Advice to Senior Management
Care about your contract employees a little more. They help run the company and keep Cisco's operations moving. Do not lie to your employees.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Great company but size has downfalls"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 25 Jan 2016

Pros
The most fair and caring company I've ever worked for. Legitimately care for their employees and customers. The lengths at which they go to please customers I have never heard or seen of before..sometimes to a fault. Have been able to navigate tricky market transitions and still stay relevant. Its a $50B company with small company feeling as the command and control structure is well thought out and cared for.

Cons
$50B companies don't move fast enough to stave off market changes/competitive threats. Internal politics - as you can imagine - are alive and well. Have a challenge in front of them as market moves to cloud based IT - not only in products but in positioning/marketing. Hard to distinguish and reward the right behavior given 'core technology' upgrades bring in more revenue then a more strategic - higher margin - business outcome sale. Although they preach work-life balance continually - its up to the individual to maintain.

Advice to Senior Management
continue being aggressive in Cloud. Find those technology areas that are REAL customer led, business focused, AND are moving to the cloud - i.e...Contact Center and invest in the products as well as people in those areas because they have already gone through the transition, sell business outcomes, and understand software and customer driven engagements.

Pros
1. Wonderful company with excellent product 2. Excellent, dedicated people ready to support young people 3. Excellent work-life balance, benefits policy and employee friendly 4. Close knit teams

Cons
1. Cisco can sometimes have too hierarchical structure, meaning that you have little independence to suggest new ideas and everything gets vetted through top management. This can be a little frustrating for the young employees.

Pros
Decent work life balance, some great people and a real commitment to CSR. Bunch of nice, if slightly clueless people.

Cons
Incredibly political, not a meritocracy. Lots of good people but degree of passive aggressive behavior is increasing every year. Promotions in lower grades based on merit, mid level onwards it's all based on who you know. Lack of innovation, playing catchup every where. Still a very top heavy company, way too many dead weight VPs that ought to have been fired long ago. Too many fiefdoms and groups. Terrible organizational design

Advice to Senior Management
Acquire some decent talent with product chops. Get your cloud strategy straight, you know you are playing catchup. People need firm direction, so enough of the touchy feely people deal. How can you compete in the world of fast moving startups led by digital natives with hopelessly backdated executives, clearly uncomfortable in social media. Abandon the culture of the celebrity CEO and really, really listen to your front line, not after its filtered by several layers of management.

Been a while since I looked around but the salary and benefits seem competitive and the company embraces flexible working hours and locations. Being a huge company, the market listens to Cisco giving opportunity to work with a variety of customers all over the world.

Cons
Software projects are distributed over too many global sites leading to inefficiency and frustration in taking and acting upon basic decisions. Proliferation of management layers leads to disconnect between those setting strategy and the rest of the organisation. Continual restructuring and an inability to redeploy workers appropriately leads to regular bouts of talented workers being let go (with corresponding impact on morale).

Advice to Senior Management
Cut out the buzzwords when presenting to staff. Install corporate tools which are less wasteful of staff time.

From Cisco Systems Business Transformation Consultant (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Thu, 21 Jan 2016

Pros
IMO Cisco is positioned as the number 1 company in the world in IT. We have innovative products across the spectrum of IT infrastructure - data center, collaboration (i.e. phones, webex, business video), networking (route/switch) and security. It is a constantly growing, dynamic company with great leadership. It gives back and does the right thing. A very high integrity company. We have great work flexibility and are able to leverage the best collaboration tools in the world to stay connected and aligned with our mission. We provide strategic solutions that can help solve business challenges of all companies around the world - i.e. speed, agility, flexibility, productivity.

Cons
It's a big company. With that there is a degree of complexity to the business. Some of our services business is a bit more difficult, giving our historical "box selling" orientation. But that is changing a lot.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep going on our digitization path, and investing in our business orientation. Invest even more in services processes and digitization. Keep the information flowing.

Pros
Fabulous access to technology. Can have a flexible schedule if Cisco employee, contract workers are more closely monitored in RTP. Meet people from all over the country.

Cons
They centralized customer service in NC to detriment of quality. They let go of proven long time remote contract workers to hire local teams who lacked the experience and desire for the positions.

Advice to Senior Management
If you are going to sell a suite of Telecommuting products actually use them internally. Please keep in mind your experienced workers are more likely to be loyal to company.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 20 Jan 2016

Pros
Flexible work option. The employees who work on the business side (program managers, business analysts, ops mgrs, etc) are very intelligent and committed to getting the job done and doing what is best for Cisco, not themselves.Lots of great personal perks, i.e. on site health center, doctors, gym, personal heath coaching. HR is trying to make Cisco "fun" again and they are making good progress. The new CEO Chuck Robbins is really nice as he looks and he will be a good leader for Cisco. He is focused and committed to making Cisco great again.

Cons
If you are 30+, I suggest you look for another company because Cisco is interested in a younger employee base (even tho all the Sr. Mgmt except 1) is over 40-50. There are little career advancement for people in this age range. If you are under 30, expect a lower pay base because of your "lack of experience." They like your new ideas but will not pay you for them. Over the past 5 years I have seen Cisco lay off thousands of "old timers," people who have been there for 10+ years and who are in the 30s/40s. Focus has been on the new blood, the newly graduated. Avoid IT because their culture is focused on looking good to their management and ignoring what customer and internal tech/users requirement are, very dog eat dog organization. In San Jose the cafeteria food is expensive and you can get a better meal off site for the same price with better quality.

Advice to Senior Management
Relearn how to appreciate employees who have chosen to stay with Cisco through their "glory" days. The "old timers" have contacts within Cisco due to their tenure and get the job done more quickly and/or efficiently versus new people. They are the ones who have refused interviews with more successful (& better stock price) high tech companies. Secondly, really, truly be strategic in business opportunities and investment. The past 15 years has been a mismanagement of new product implementation that ends up failing resulting in laying people off; the lack of strategy is failure on Sr. Management.

From Cisco Systems Business Operations (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 18 Jan 2016

Pros
Challenging if in the correct group and, or project. Opportunity exists to learn about global business and current industry trends an challenges impacting long term global expansion and corporate sustainability. There is much groundbreaking initiatives on the radar or in progress and an willingness to do it right. Sense of urgency is present regarding these efforts and within the LOBs associated to the work.

Cons
Bloated. Not everyone is doing their bit. Significant passing the buck, and for every achiever, there are multiple non achievers. A significant degree of complacency, which includes biding time for longer term employees. People are staying for the wrong reasons, sapping energy and motivation of those that care. Too many contractors with core knowledge covering for SME roles. Allows the FTEs/SMEs ability to cruise and internal business knowledge is being diluted.

Advice to Senior Management
Weed out the slackers, monitor performance better particularly the WFH culture. Transfer (pullback) core knowledge from contractors and consultants and redirect to Cisco employees. Hold Cisco employees accountable for knowing, and understanding core versus context.

Pros
Good company to work for. Excellent benefits and compensation. Very flexible with corporate policies and procedures and the culture.

Cons
As long as the Business Unit is bringing good revenue, you are good. The moment BU revenue goes flat or negative YoY, the jobs will be sent to Low Cost locations. Some bad elements always look for building empire and better stay away from such BU's and the leaders.

Advice to Senior Management
When selecting top leaders, always take feedback bottoms up on what challenges the Org is going through so you can pick the right level of leadership. Bring in fresh blood from outside for leadership positions.

clear distinction between Red badge and Blue. Red badges are considered as a Temp workers and mostly hired for short term jobs and to support Regular employee/manager support. if you are experienced then never join as a red badge otherwise just for few bucks you will loose your dignity and don't be surprise when you have to leave the job in 2 weeks.

Stop the culture of Red Vs Blue.

If you want to learn, you have TONS of resources, many many to choose from.

Cons
For some reason I thought that working for Cisco would be different...somehow disappointed with it. I do work, have no problems with that, however, a concise compensation needs to be in place. Came to meet many people where cannot learn something new on the weekends because they have to work and dont have time.

Sub par pay compared to peer firms Excessive cliques and internecine politics Some projects/managers/BUs demand insane work hours, upsetting work-life balance Overselling company benefits to employees causes disgruntlement

Advice to Senior Management
Be coherent in communication - line managers speak a different language from official communication Significantly improve pay across board, and specifically at mid level (G-10 to G-12) grades. Entry level salaries look bloated in comparison to mid level pay. Yet, middle level grades are made to look like aspiration to ran and file.

Pros
Great company to work for, great culture, good compensation, good team spirit. Senior execs have good vision for future of company and always pushing to lead.

Cons
Management could do a better job communicating vision down to the rest of the employees. Also, some management tended to "scream fire" when there was none, no need for this.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Thu, 14 Jan 2016

Pros
It is an honour to work with such great people. Cisco's culture is something I strongly believe and why I work here. Flexible working also works very well for employees, Cisco and Cisco's customers. Another example of freedom of choice is your tool. You can select Mac or PC, choose your own phone or tablet, etc.

Cons
Can't think of any. It can be very busy sometimes but I guess that also depends on your time and work management skills as well.

Advice to Senior Management
Support alternative ways of transport - car sharing perhaps.

From Cisco Systems Senior User Experience Designer (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Thu, 14 Jan 2016

Pros
The San Jose campus is huge and often feels like several small companies rather than a large on. Your experience can therefore vary greatly depending on your Business unit / Department. That said, there are some very sharp folks working at Cisco, folks you can learn from provided that put in the effort to reach out and show interest. Depending on your field, Cisco will give you the opportunity to work on groundbreaking projects and technologies. I found benefits and salaries to be competitive

Cons
As it is often the case in large companies, you will bump into folks content with Status Quo. They typically have held their job for many years and are not interested in change, even when shown it is necessary and beneficial. Quite often, those folks have not kept their skills up to date, giving you the impression to step back in time. Changes in the organisation often mean changes in priorities, when they occur faster than it takes to ship a project, some of your work might be wasted.

Advice to Senior Management
Support managers and teams who deliver results and have the company's success in mind rather than their own.

Pros
Excellent vacation (20+ days), extremely flexible attitude to telecommuting. Very collaborative culture (in marketing, at least). Very strongly profitable company, and overall reasonably well-run. Good top-down communication and transparency.

Cons
Pretty chaotic at senior leader levels since new CEO Robbins was announced. A lot of layoffs, executive departures...tried and trusted people, processes thrown out without much regard for whether they were effective or not. Either good (tough) decision making, or leaders doing whatever they think they need to do to curry favor with the new CEO. Hard to know which currently.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't throw the baby out with the bath water.

From Cisco Systems Marketing Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Wed, 13 Jan 2016

Pros
Work from home. Little management and little work to do. It's like getting paid full time to do a part time job from home.

Cons
Poor management and poor understanding of the technology being marketed. Little appreciation for employees and very few opportunities to grow your career. Low pay. A lot of jockeying for position rather than doing any work. Your colleagues will likely be taking their kids to soccer practice while on a WebEx meeting with you.

Advice to Senior Management
Learn about what each employee is responsible for. Recognize talent rather than aggressive power plays from employees trying to get ahead.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineering Manager (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 13 Jan 2016

Pros
Latest and greatest for network equipment and 40Gb+ optical stuff.

Cons
Just remember that Cisco is a company run by sales people. The engineers are an unfortunate evil required to sell more equipment. If the senior executives could get rid of of the engineers ( or replace them with engineers from India or China ) they would.

Advice to Senior Management
Acquiring companies to avoid having to invest in engineering is a valid strategy, but boy it sucks when you are one of the engineers that get acquired.

Pros
Great Company, good benefits, great people

Cons
Takes too long to get anything done. Too many managers doing too few things. Upper management has a tendency to not write anything down. Expectation is to get consensus from bottom up all the time so that the management do not have to make any decision

Advice to Senior Management
Simplify the decision process. Management needs to make decisions sometimes that is not based on consensus. Management needs to write things down on a piece of paper so that it can be tracked and they can be accountable for the decision they make.

Cisco has adopted the Agile in a big way, its Campus is massive and state of the art and also the transport facility is excellent

Advice to Senior Management
Not to prefer candidates based on their experience, qualifications and accomplishments on the academics only. Instead give more emphasis to hard-work, talent, technical skills, soft skills and being a team player

From Cisco Systems Marketing Leader (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Sun, 10 Jan 2016

Pros
Big company, areas of potential growth, good company to get some experience working for. Nice perks, great benefits, good pay.

Cons
Not growing except thru acquisitions means it doesn't innovate itself or its core. Stock price will be largely flat/steady, so don't expect a lot of value there. It creates profit and Wall Street positives by cutting costs, which means people are often laid-off and program spending is often cut. The politics are especially harsh. The marketing and communications team is especially dysfunctional due to a terrible CMO surrounded by her lackluster band of mediocre talents.

Advice to Senior Management
Dump the current comms and marketing leadership and get some real talent in there. New CEO Chuck Robbins should pay more attention to the level of talent he has chosen to put in place, and the political moves and broken trust beneath his inner circle.

Cons
Hi stress/workload makes difficult work-life balance. Upward mobility is very challenging as you are competing across multiple technologies and multiple theatres for limited grade increases that are available. They will definitely polish the carrot for you to chase, but you really need to make friends in high places to go anywhere.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 8 Jan 2016

Pros
People who work hard and are committed, is show equal commitment from the company as well. Job satisfaction is more if you are equally invested in what you are doing. Lateral movements is possible if you prove your worth. Work culture/Benefits depends on the BU you are working in.

Cons
Since it is a large company, sometimes your hard work is rated from among the teams accross CISCO. Benefits also might depend on how well the company does in that quarter which is not directly influenced solely from your team's work. But having said that, it depends on the team/BU you are working.

Advice to Senior Management
More focus on developing in house talent pool and recognizing the best efforts more pro-actively.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Software Engineer says "Work Hard and Deliver Results"

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer (Past Employee - 2016) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Fri, 8 Jan 2016

Pros
Cisco is a great place to work, and as long as you're willing to work hard and deliver results for customers, you will be rewarded for the work that you do. There have been concrete changes to streamline management in order to facilitate Agile development, with an emphasis on iterative development and continuous integration. I have been impressed with Cisco's adaptation to today's challenging environment and as long as Cisco continues to act on feedback from both customers and individual contributors (i.e. employees), I am positive for Cisco's future. Cisco provides ample opportunities for promotions and career advancements as long as you deliver results and meet or surpass expectations. At least the managers I have worked with have been very professional and will work hard to support you and your professional goals. Overall, my experience at Cisco over the years has been very good. Cisco has gone through some tough changes in recent years. However, I am positive Cisco has come out on the other side much stronger and resilient.

Cons
There are secular market trends working against Cisco, and competitors are causing disruptions to the company. The Cisco of today is markedly different from the Cisco of yesteryear, so hopefully they will be able to turn things around.

Advice to Senior Management
I have been impressed by management's boldness to make concrete changes in management structure and proactively communicating them to everyone in the organization. The transparency is much appreciated.

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 8 Jan 2016

Pros
Depending on your team and your customer(s), you will have very different experiences. I've been lucky enough to come in through their new hire program (CSAP - Cisco Sales Associates Program) and consistently be part of very young, energetic teams. I love the aggressiveness and go-getter mentality prevalent within my team, and my organization as a whole. It matches very well with the energy we experience working with our customers in Silicon Valley. I've also had great luck with managers -- they are caring and involved, notice the work you as an individual contributor are putting in, and really show their appreciation.

Cons
Cisco is of course a very large company, and with it comes the extensive red tape that makes significant change difficult. So, although you get incredible stability and perks working with such a well established organization, it is also very hard to instigate change. Trying to change how a particular product platform works or add significant feature improvements across multiple platforms will take a very long time.

Advice to Senior Management
Please listen to what we are saying from the field! Competition, especially in the Bay Area, is extremely intense, and we need to innovate more quickly and respond to field feedback more quickly to stay ahead.

Management in this place is a joke, they all lie to cover for each other, HR is the worst I have ever seen. They are supposed to investigate claims by employers, they go directly to the manager tell them that there is a compliant against them and then come back and tell you that they found no bass for your claim. JOKE !!! Stay away from these people, you don't need that negativity in your life.

Pros
My internship experience at Cisco was truly life-changing. As in intern, I was given extremely meaningful assignments and I was able to make an impact. My teammates and manager worked closely with me to help me be successful. The corporate culture at Cisco is amazing and I enjoyed going to work every day. At least once a week, the interns got to attend interesting talks and lunches with Cisco leaders to learn more about the company. Cisco Rocks!

Cons
I did not have any negative experiences working for Cisco. If any interns expressed complaints, the issues were handled immediately to improve our experience.

Advice to Senior Management
Please keep the intern experience as interactive, innovative, and fun as my experience was as a GMCC intern. You did an amazing job utilizing your interns and providing us with opportunities to succeed at Cisco.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 6 Jan 2016

Pros
Cisco Systems at RTP by far has been one of the best experiences. The University Experience team and made the process seamless. As an intern, onboarding week made me feel comfortable and welcomed with open arms. The opportunities at Cisco Systems are endless. With the love and support of my colleagues, I was given the opportunity to learn about myself, team work and why Cisco Systems is the #1 Technology company in the world. My projects were challenging and one-one-one sessions with key stakeholders in the company were engaging as well. I was given the opportunity to solve one of Cisco's problems and present my findings to management, and the VP of my org. Definitely my best internship by far and would recommend the company to others. I have chosen to stay at Cisco for my first post-college career position.

Cons
Not so much of a bad thing, but Cisco is what you make it! It is completely up to you on how your career will be at the company. I have learned this very quickly in my internship and will be keep it with me as I begin full-time.

From Cisco Systems Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 5 Jan 2016

Pros
This internship was such an amazing opportunity! In one summer full of fun & learning, with new experiences each and every day, Cisco Systems and employees taught me more than I ever imagined. I had access to industry professionals, the work was meaningful (I never was the coffee runner), the pay was VERY COMPETITIVE, built upon skills and gained new skills I could use on any job, and the whole summer was full of networking and personal and career building tasks. I would recommend this internship to anyone who is willing to have a team of managers and personal mentor who will see their flaws and help you build upon them, also someone who is hardworking and never gives up!

Cons
They gave us Mac laptops, I didnt know how to use it in the beginning but I caught on fast and LOVED IT!

Advice to Senior Management
Management was great, I have no words other than Cisco ROCKS!

Pros
My team had a very close collaboration culture. Lots of interesting work with the ability to implement leading best practices in digital marketing. Emphasis on aligning with other teams and making sure that activities were coordinated between groups.

Cons
Political maneuvering at the top meant lots of reorgs and layoffs. That was hard on our team, which had cultivated deep friendships and trust over the years. Really devastating, because cuts were made not based on skills but based on $$.

Advice to Senior Management
Methodical business planning and implementation would enable more strategic staff reorganizations and improve morale. Stop with knee-jerk management and listen to your employees!

Advice to Senior Management
It looks like in every restructuring there is not consideration to the talent that is being let go since the decisions are based on business areas instead of individual performance. If a restructuring needs to be done, keep the good talent and move it to a different area

Cons
+ If you are from good institute, expecting good companies, and you get this offer from out-campus with job as contract employee, be aware that it may delay your career growth + Conversion from contract to full-time employee is long, even though manager proposes as few 6-8 months + Slightly politics plays it's role while getting promote or convert + You will have to spend at least 3 years to get out with experience in your hand, make sure you can work as contract employee till then + Even after conversion, you will have to spend one year as promised, so delays you again. + Concluding: If you don't have any other opportunity then without looking twice accept it.

Pros
I will retire here. I love it. IoE is where it is at. #gotioe #ioe #iot

Cons
I wish I had a bit more interaction with all of the amazingly brilliant people that I work with. However since we all work from home it is limited. But I am NOT at all complaining!! :0)

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 4 Jan 2016

Pros
Had the opportunity to work with business professionals in New York City with the Public Sector Sales team with Cisco. Was paid very competitively during my time and worked on projects where I was able to see the result of my work positively impact the business. I also had an abundance of shadowing opportunities with industry veterans.

Cons
I was really happy with my time interning with Cisco and did not think the internship had too many major drawbacks.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep up the good work! I cannot say enough good things about Cisco and this internship.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 4 Jan 2016

Pros
Fantastic culture - culture will vary from team to team, but from what I've seen the teams are close. Everyone supports each other. Furthermore, everyone is extremely smart and NICE. As an intern, everyone in the office was willing to chat with me about topics ranging from career advice to the World Cup. Market leaders - it's not a startup culture where you're going to have to convince a company to set up meetings with you so you can pitch your product. The people at Cisco have been cultivating these relationships with companies for years. Thus, when I would sit in on sales calls and meetings, I was truly learning from some of the industry's best reps and engineers. Executive speaker series - I got to learn from people who have been in the industry for decades and how to go about navigating my career. Their wisdom is invaluable and they picked some truly inspirational people to talk to us!

Cons
The EIC program was new so there were some issues that need to be worked out, such as correspondence with the account managers whom we were assigned to work with. Sometimes the accounts were not high priority for the AMs at the time. There was almost too much down-time for my liking, as we were assigned an account every 1.5 weeks and most of the account research and presentation would be done before then.

Advice to Senior Management
Perhaps for the EIC program, as it continues to grow, assign more than one person to help manage the program. When there were pressing questions/issues and the program manager wasn't available it was frustrating to wait. Please assign more projects and assignments other than account research.

Pros
Top notch technology, growth in large number of categories / technologies, global company with ability to move / relocate for career

Advice to Senior Management
Look to promote people who actually contribute, rather than just those who are the most enjoyable to drink with.

Pros
Bedrijf met goede visie en strategie die al tientallen jaren er voor zorgt dat wij toonaangevend in de markt zijn. Een echte toughleader waar veel bedrijven tegen op kijken. Als werknemer is Cisco een sociaal bedrijf dat opkomt voor het wel en wee van zijn mensen.

From Cisco Systems Solutions Architect (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Thu, 31 Dec 2015

Pros
Access to great minds. If you network, you have a lot of access to people that can help and help you advance positions. You can get a position that requires travel to stay in your preferred area. Training is always available for free for Cisco products, but I always had training for other company products as a choice.

Cons
It's harder to advance if you are in the technical side and not in a major city where Cisco has a presence. Big company politics (just like any other). Lots of organizational changes. Sales organization is favored over other divisions.

From Cisco Systems Program Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 30 Dec 2015

Pros
Many social activities, employees are treated very well (bear in mind that's around 50 - 60% of all the staff, rest are contractors)

Cons
Culture affected by 40% of contractors around - not such a 'family' feel as could otherwise be the case. Management, people management and leadership skills of many managers lacking - possibly no training for them from HR and many people stay at Cisco for a long time and therefore move up without coaching, etc. No job descriptions - I might have been unlucky but both my jobs came with no or poor job descriptions. This resulted in being asked to do things that were not agreed during my interview and me needing to defend my role. It also resulted in a new manager being assigned to us without any prior experience in our area.

Advice to Senior Management
Be smarter with putting the right people with right skills into the right jobs (that's what JDs tend to be for) + invest into training of your leaders and managers + get feedback from both employees and contractors about how their management is doing since your pool of contractors is certainly not small

Pros
- good team work and people who want to create great products - management is supportive - good work-life balance

Cons
- company is shifting to cloud based and away from making products. - mechanical teams are part of hardware organization. - senior managers seem like they don't know what is going on. - few skip level meetings. - little long term planning or development of engineering team

Advice to Senior Management
- get to know your team and listen to their advice. - why do they make such bad decisions when acquiring companies? - I feel Cisco should develop core values like other companies such as IBM, Apple, etc. I have been here more than 5 years and I still can't explain Cisco's values. -

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 29 Dec 2015

Pros
Great people is the biggest assets. For an extremely large company Cisco manages to maintain itself as an amazing company dedicated to changing the world - and making a profit. Lots of engaged people, lots of brand recognition and tons of internal opportunities. Work flexibility is a huge plus, there is a lot of autonomy and trust within the organization (this could also be a con when abused)

Cons
Seems like the organization is getting fatter at the top, and not enough middle management or growth opportunities. Because many people have worked there for many years, they can be set in their ways or play favorites.

the so called practice of "transparency" is not really practiced, Direct line managers need to feel confident and support individual contributor teams, when channeling information to upper level management.

From Cisco Systems ASIC Design Engineer (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 5 of 5 found this helpful — Thu, 24 Dec 2015

Pros
Generally speaking the work environment is very flexible, as long as you're producing quality work. The compensation was reasonable, but it varies widely based on what group you're in and what projects you're working on. The newer projects obviously get priority when it comes to budget, as well as the workload.

Cons
As said in another review of Cisco that I read, it is very easy to slowly get sucked-in and end up working 14 hour days. Generally speaking, you will be rewarded based on what you put into it. So if you choose to put up boundaries and stick to a 40-hour week, you'll be comfy and cozy. If you choose to put in 60-80 hour weeks, you're likely to be elevated in the long term (provided you're not in a group that's approaching "sustaining-mode" where there is very little new development). If you're lucky enough to get into the "in-crowd" and you're a hard worker that puts out quality product, you're set for life. Cisco has a very elite group of people that jump ship every few years, create a new start-up (i.e. ensime, nuovo, andiamo), work their tails' off, get purchased by Cisco making tons of money, and repeat. But getting into that group is extremely difficult even if you're good at what you do. There's a bit of class-ism in the Cisco HW department.

Advice to Senior Management
I don't have any advice. Cisco is a giant machine that is fiercely loyal to it's shareholders. It's no longer a place for good people to grow into great ones. It's just a place where a few great engineers hold reign over lots of good/average engineers. I was there for 8 years. I would do about 60% of it over again, but I wouldn't stick around as long. If you're standing still there, you're moving backwards.

Pros
Thriving on its ability to continually outperform competition and markets, Cisco is an establishment where you can learn fast, be independent and grow according to your capability to adapt and change.

Cons
With its consistent culture of providing the best for full timers and senior management, it becomes tricky to know how to navigate your way. Watch who you see as a leader and who you think is a mentor. Never judge a book by its hierarchical cover. Advise to do deep checks on who your hiring manager is and negotiate well on your salary and benefits.

Advice to Senior Management
No one is perfect, kudos so far. Might help to go back to basics of grooming your people to provide what is good to partners and customers.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 23 Dec 2015

Pros
1st Week of Orientation, they really take care of you well. Catered lunches, tossing around a water balloon, Dave N' Busters party. Big Companies have fun events / orientation. The rest of the summer you get paid well for not being too useful. Interns generally are not of much use from what I observed, the learning curve takes a month or so, and so your potential productivity can only be a few weeks. They're not hiring you for your work-output, but to entice you to come work there full-time. I'm glad I interned here, it was great to try a big company, the pay was good, and it served as a great stepping-stone on my resume.

Cons
Your experience is highly dependent on your mentor / manager. They're the ones assigning you work, and they'll be the ones deciding whether you get a return offer. If your manager is non-technical, then your mentor will almost exclusively decide himself/herself. This isn't so much a con as much of a warning. I know other interns in my program who weren't happy with their mentor/managers and didn't receive any guidance from them. One definitive Con is that I wasn't integrated very well with my team. I talked to them a handful of times over the summer but I think they barely knew who I was, so I didn't get a great inclusive-feel. I only got to know the contractor sitting directly next to me.

Pros
There is opportunity to learn software if you want to or need to such as SAP and Oracle products. Cisco also gives contractors free transit passes while you work here which is nice.

Cons
The chances of being made permanent are very very slim, so it is debatable how good the opportunity is here. If you have no other employment then it is good; otherwise, if you have other opportunities, pursue those first.

Pros
Cisco is an international powerhouse that has significant presence in almost every country in the world. They strive to stay on the cutting edge of technology as they compete against all comers in the international network technology space.

Cons
Cisco is a "tale of two cities" having a smaller full-time employee force of around 25,000 full-time employees worldwide that is complemented by a much larger outside contractor workforce that they turn over very quickly based upon a contractor's length of contract. As an outside contractor, it is very apparent that you are treated as a second class worker that is thrown into a large pool of other outside contractors. Consequently, contractor morale is very bad and as such Cisco's work environment is quite toxic.

Advice to Senior Management
Cisco senior management needs to make a strong effort to examine the horrendous work environment they've created and take the steps necessary to ensure that all workers, both permanent and outsourced are made to feel as though they are working for the same team.

Pros
Great culture to work in. Overall Management is good with some pockets of "how did they get here?" Fun place to work with really good benefits. Pay is pretty good for industry, but movement can be restrictive by HR red tape. "We will promote you for your same current pay" kind of stuff.

Cons
Don't get stuck in non essential roles. Every October, they clean house at or around 10% of workforce.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep the culture small, with customer focus and doing the right thing at the forefront. Focus where the market is strong and don't spread the portfolio so thin.

Market leading products, world class engineers, and loyal customers. The best product support in the industry, and the biggest reseller channel in the world.

Cons
There are so many products that you need to understand. From video surveillance to wireless to communications, there are lots of niche competitors that have a single pitch against Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Fix the commission structure for selling advanced technologies. It takes 5-10X the cycles to sell full-scale ATs, and the deal sizes are 50-90% less than full-scale switch refreshes.

There will be all kinds of ways that you and your staff could spend your time, many of them quite worthy. But some will have more of an impact than others, and those are the ones you need to focus on—which means saying no to the others.

Pros
Company benefits are outstanding, the tops in the industry. Highly competitive environment, flexible scheduling, with some of the most talented people in the industry.

Cons
Lots of redundancy between teams in the same business unit as well as the rest of the company. This is due to the company treating all teams as their own startup. The good is that it allows teams to build and identity and business for themselves, the bad is that when resources are scarce, the political games begin and rather than collaborate, you end up with multiple versions of the same product or service with varying degrees of quality. Lack of structure or structure that is not properly defined. Your success is dependent on the manager you get. No longer looking to hire experience, only looking to rent it.

Advice to Senior Management
Management needs to bring in a little bit more structure not bureaucracy. Rather than having a someone come up with an idea, building it themselves, and attempt to take it to market - have them actually use teams specifically for those tasks.

Pros
Remote work opportunity to learn new things network with people from all parts of the organization with Cisco experience easy to get rehired as a contractor

Cons
Contractors get looked down on by perm very little opportunity to convert Contractors who get cut from a position get referred to as being on "wavier wire" and passed around Expected to work all hours on global teams and over 40 hours Must be on Jabber at all times making interruptions constant very political

Advice to Senior Management
Develop a greater understanding of your products and processes rather than believing what is presented to you. Management sees a very different view of the organization than workers do.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Human Resources Intern says "HR Intern"

From Cisco Systems Human Resources Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Thu, 17 Dec 2015

Pros
The HR internship was a phenomenal experience. I got to work with different areas of Cisco and had real ownership over my projects. The program itself is constantly improving because the senior leadership is willing to listen to us on how to improve. Love the flexibility within Cisco as well. My co-workers were awesome too!

Cons
Because Cisco is such a huge company, it can be difficult to find people or fun events to participate in. Unlike some of the start ups around, there isn't a happy hour after work every day to make friends and get to know people. That's the trade off for being at a more established and stable company.

Advice to Senior Management
Use young people more in Cisco We might not ave the technical skills yet, but many of us are overflowing with new and creative ideas to change the status quo.

Pros
Cisco is a good place to grow a career in product management as they have mastered enterprise networking and have account control in very large accounts.

Cons
Don't expect to be working on anything too cutting edge (Cloud/SaaS) or using the latest development practices (Agile/Devops).

From Cisco Systems Intern - Hourly (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 16 Dec 2015

Pros
Cisco is an established company who knows what they're doing. They are serious about their image as a family oriented company. It really feels like you are part of a community, although I'm sure that view changes wildly based on your team.

Cons
They are a large corporation, with a large and strange bureaucracy at times. Everything moves slowly and requires quite a bit of fighting to get pushed through.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't lose the culture. Remember what makes Cisco different from other companies. Don't be afraid to make the hard decisions.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Dec 2015

Pros
Exciting new leadership - at all levels of the company - so the company feels very energizing and focused. Spending a lot of time and attention on investing in people - engagement, recognition, performance as well as salary and merit money. Good bonus structure and benefits.

Cons
The biggest challenge is the ability to change jobs within the company. Creating or influencing change is also difficult - like moving a battleship.

Advice to Senior Management
We cannot develop if we cannot find new opportunities in the company. If the organization does not focus on finding ways to create internal movement, they will continue to see talent leaving the company.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Dec 2015

Pros
Good benefits. For the most part management open to teleworking. Good technology, top in their field. Stable Company, money in bank. Salaries competitive.

Cons
Promotions difficult to get. Will try to bring you in at a level or two below what you are worth -- don't bite. Aggressive acquisition strategy leads to yearly layoffs which they disguise as limited restructuring. Say they want you to be innovative don't believe them, they buy their innovation, and when it comes down to it not appreciative of it. People management skill level low.

Advice to Senior Management
Back up what you say. People will only believe you for so long.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Dec 2015

Pros
Cisco payscales are very good. Benefits and Bonus are great too. If you are in senior mgmt you get good RSU's which are icing on the overall compensation package.

Cons
Cisco is not the same company it was 10 years ago. No more the IT bell weather stock company it was a few years ago. Still a good place to work mainly because of the compensation. But overall, there is no clear direction of where the company is heading..

Advice to Senior Management
R&S is going to slowly lose its significance. Have a clear strategy for Data Center or Security and go full steam ahead.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 14 Dec 2015

Pros
Work Life balance. Opportunity to interact with big names in industry (if you take the initiative), you get to learn a lot from such experiences. Fairly open management. People are helpful. I loved working with the people here.

Cons
Opportunities to grow are few. Cisco is a sluggish mover. People tend to be on cruise-mode. Lack of innovative initiatives from within the company, to be fair, there are platforms created, but, somehow the products/ideas which come out of them die (again, a lot of times, because of the bureaucratic, sluggish nature of the process to productize it.)

Advice to Senior Management
Need to be more nimble. There are certain products which are cruising, move the best engineers out from them and put them in more challenging roles. If a good engineer is not challenged enough, either he/she would get rusted or just move on. Need to work to bring back the "COOLNESS" back in Cisco. From being the most sort after company to work for, it has turned into an archaic old-school company to work for.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 14 Dec 2015

Pros
Excellent Bonus, Good work life balance, flexible timing, work-from-home, No desktops at all, everyone gets laptop. Great resting place between two demanding jobs, may be for an year or two People including Managers are very good, treatment of employees is very good Cafeteria facilities are very good, at least in Cessna Business Park which houses Cisco's own campus. Transport facility is there at a reasonable price for permanent employees, contractors can avail of it but pretty expensive for them. Easy hiring for contractors, the process is tougher for permanent employees

Cons
Not a great place if you are career-oriented. Things move too slowly, and hardly anything ever gets done Vision and Strategy is missing for most BUs. No long-term thinking. Stay longer, and employability outside decreases phenomenally Ad-hoc, difficult-to-explain firings (not necessarily bad performers) Promotions are very difficult. Un-organized hierarchy, nobody know which designation is senior or junior, or who falls where. No HR involvement once you get hired, they only recruit you after that they never check on you. Contractors to Permanent Employees ratio is approx 8:2 (this could be BU specific), and hiring of contractual workers is very lenient, so you end up with lots of poor performers.

Advice to Senior Management
Get a vision

Pros
Cisco is a fun place to work, at least if you're in the sales part of the business. You can usually work from home and take flexible hours provided you're serving your customers well. Career options are great, you can move around the business relatively easily. Opportunities to move to different countries are frequent and often encouraged. Lots of opportunities to do side projects and define your own activities. Very little 'micro-managing'. Rewards outside of base pay are encouraged and easy to distribute, creating a good culture with positive feedback.

Cons
No inflationary payrises. Very difficult to get promotions without being a skilled political operative. Managers powerless to help employees in this area as they don't control any budget. Everything goes through a big HR machine. Everything and everyone is a number and cost to be reduced. Managers are usually looking upwards focussed on their own careers, not paying attention to their employees. Can go months without a performance review or any guidance as to your own career. Promotions, payrises etc all shrouded in secrecy. Leavers usually not replaced, or replaced slowly. Being 5 heads down is common and workload thrown to employees without any consultation or apology. This in turn affects sales commission. Technical strategy is weak in areas due to massive in-fightning between business units. Huge egos run parts of the business. Fear is a frequently used motivational tool.

Advice to Senior Management
Look after employees better, focus on their careers (their success will make your success). Spend the time needed to help them with reviews, pay and so on. Don't be opaque about it salaries. Be honest when people leave and address the team; don't let everyone find out on the grapevine. You've got the fun down well, now make it rewarding and focus on our careers!

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 11 Dec 2015

Pros
The CEO just turned over, and the new CEO is showing signs of positive change, which are already showing throughout the organization. A focus on cloud, a desire to for organizational agility. Smart, aggressive people get rewarded.

Cons
Not everyone has gotten the memo that things are changing at Cisco. It gets difficult to rally the entire organization, because the entire organization is so massive.

Advice to Senior Management
Communicate the changes in Cisco outside of Cisco. I wouldn't have believed it had I not lived it.

Cons

From Cisco Systems Business Analyst (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 11 Dec 2015

Pros
Wonderful people: smart, capable, caring, and fun to be around. The Cisco employees I worked with are friends as well as as work-mates. Cool products: Cisco usually has products at the front edge of technology and they have the money and influence to make things happen.

Cons
Lack of clarity about the mission, incoherent execution. Probably because of it's R&D-by-acquisition approach Cisco has internal silos and no coherent, cross-functional, operations capability so it is inefficient and has difficulty focusing on a clearly defined objective.

Advice to Senior Management
Efficiency and effectiveness will become more of a differentiator and without a strong enterprise operations capability margins will continue to erode.

Pros
You have the ability to cease any opportunity and work through any and all area's that you are familiar with. This may sound impossible but if you can handle your core functions, there are many other area's that like to work cross-functionally to build relationships and drive initiatives globally.

Cons
There really are not a lot of con's. Assuming you are willing to step up and be heard, there will be opportunities for you to grow and lead.

Pros
Good if you are looking for a low stress job with flexible work environment.

Cons
Did not enjoy working through a preferred supplier. No growth opportunities. Complacent, stagnating work environment. Teams can be filled with friends and former colleagues of hiring managers.

Advice to Senior Management
Hire great talent and motivate them through outstanding growth opportunities, feedback, training and benefits. The route through preferred suppliers can create an unhealthy, complacent work environment, lacking motivation. Poor decisions and lack of productivity can be very costly in the long run.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer II (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 8 Dec 2015

Pros
Good company, good people to work with, good work life balance, lot of scope to explore and learn new things.

Cons
The hikes in subsequent years are not very high and need to wait for longer duration for promotion. You need to inform your manager prior and tell him that you are looking for promotion otherwise you wont get the promotion even if you are top performer for consecutive years.

Advice to Senior Management
They should revise the salary for the existing experienced peoples. It should not happen like that people with good amount of experience and in top performer list getting lesser than the college new hires.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 8 Dec 2015

Pros
Good benefit package and a lot of flexibility to work from home or otherwise remotely.

Cons
It's really hard to get promoted from within. Cisco tends to hire from the outside rather than grooming a team from within. It's disheartening since the insiders have the company experience and background.

Advice to Senior Management
Stop the constant change.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 8 Dec 2015

Pros
Great working environment, hands on learning, good mentorship and positive co workers overall, pros outweighed the cons and it was a great internship.

Cons
Sometimes, days were long. Sometimes unclear what was required (lack of strong organisation), not strong relocation support

Advice to Senior Management
Management definitely should provide stronger relocation support, in addition to more organisation and structure for interns. Definitely keep the positive community culture.

From Cisco Systems Account Manger (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Tue, 8 Dec 2015

Pros
Great culture, everyone happy to collaborate and help each other. Management hierarchy is relatively flat and most managers are very open to conversations and getting stuck in at all levels of the business. Packages are competitive, and the commission get's exciting when you star to overachieve.. Cisco of course carries a big brand into a lot of accounts so getting in front of customers is never a challenge...

Cons
Still a hardware vendor first, massively needs to look at becoming more software driven, and refining the cloud proposition - and fast. Work needs to be done on Cisco's business relevance to IoT, digitization and the move towards applications and software.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on the future of the business, not the short term weekly forecast/hardware sales.

Cons
Compensation Partiality between employees of acquired company & people directly recruited by Cisco. Micro management & too much process oriented rather than result oriented.

Advice to Senior Management
Budget is the answer for many advises to facilitate employees of a acquired company. So, people stop advising at some point of time.

From Cisco Systems Manager, Software Development (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Sun, 6 Dec 2015

Pros
There's always opportunities within Cisco to learn and grow. The environment is for the most part supportive. Work is plentiful and the competitors keep the work interesting.

Cons
Offshoring and hiring H1B workers is abused by Cisco. There's a lot of benefit in having a diverse workforce and the org chart in engineering is almost entirely indian or asian. It's difficult to attract new grads in the US in this type of environment.

Advice to Senior Management
Understand the impact of the H1B program and how it hurts the company in the long run. Restructuring is typically a good thing, but having yearly layoffs and hiring offshore instead results in bad morale and an indifference to making cisco successful.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer Intern (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Sun, 6 Dec 2015

Pros
Cisco offers employees great flexibility and work-life balance. The company is a market leader in all domains it competes in and has adapted well to market changes. There were many programs and events organised to engage interns and help them network with other teams.

Cons
The salary offered to interns is quite low. (For full-time roles the pay is at par with other tech companies, but there are fewer benefits offered.)

Advice to Senior Management
Keep pushing forward in the areas of cloud and data-center as they already are doing. Work on revamping the culture to align with newer technology focused companies in the area.

Pros
Cisco remains a challenging environment, driven for excellence. For those able to keep up, you're rewarded well, and surrounded by expert peers, managers, and senior managers committed to your success. Training, lab equipment, peer support are readily available for any assignment or task. The mutual respect and support make Cisco a wonderful place to work. The good pay and excellent benefits add icing to the cake. Working from home is a huge plus! The customers are also very easy to work with because they recognize and respect the level of expertise Cisco engineers bring to the conversation. I love my customers!

Cons
The demand for your expertise is constant. You have to know how to delegate responsibility to other teams, and learn how to use your resources, the sales team, and partners to get the job done. Otherwise, you'll end up working 12 hour days constantly. (My colleagues who don't delegate are probably accusing me of only working half a day!)

Advice to Senior Management
Cisco's broad technical expertise and product completeness win deals all day long but customers complain about the level of expertise needed to manage them. We should continue to expand our managed services portfolio, and offer regular 'health checks' to ensure customers are up to date in software and configuration.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Sat, 5 Dec 2015

Pros
Was once a great company when I started. I call this Cisco 1.0. A lot of momentum and product is very sticky. Powerful company that owns their partner community. Some very good people

Cons
Many of the managers think their customer is their boss. They sell up and forget that the real Big C customer can fire them instantly unlike the managers who don't have real Big C customers. They missed two huge transitions, cloud and virtualization. ACI is an attempt to put the cat back into the proprietary bag similar to IBM with Micro Channel. Customers do not want lock in and also want quicker feature delivery which means software.

Advice to Senior Management
Get out, get down in the trenches and talk to the people who are on the front lines. Encourage them to be honest and don't punish. Tell all managers that if you don't have a Big C customer you support directly your Little C customer is then most important. Your boss is not your customer, he will watch how you support you big C or little C customer and reward you accordingly. Without this approach you are quickly heading to the same result as IBM. I saw that movie as well and it didn't end well.

Pros
-Healthcare -Employee Stock Purchase Plan -3-year hardware refresh -Ability to telecommute

Cons
-Horrible funds for the 401k in addition to a very low match -Employees are not awarded based on their performance, but rather who ingratiates themselves with management the most. -Managers are inept and often generations behind in their understanding of technologies. -Promotions are awarded based on who directors/VP, etc. like not on true performance. -Micro management nightmare

Advice to Senior Management
Get rid of the bloat within middle and senior management. You are no longer innovative and continue trying to catch up to more innovative companies (Palo Alto for example). Those currently employed in middle and upper management do not understand the current tech environment and are often former DBAs, etc.

Pros
World class company. Many Type A employees. $50B in revenue which makes it tough to grow significantly. Top compensation packages and benefits. Many interesting projects on routing and switching, cloud and IoT.

Cons
Frequent reorganizations and layoffs. Most of the business is stilled tied to routing and switching which are slow growing businesses. Disorganized and Constant budget pressure and the need to do more with less resources. Lots of hidden headcount with contractors which account for 70K heads.

Advice to Senior Management
Stop the continual reorgs and layoffs. More transparency on how the executive team is being measured and rewarded. Do a better job of setting budgets. Allow more time for impacted employees to find a job internally.

Cons
The company is always going through ups and down in hiring, which can be stressful.

Pros
Great experience. Get to see all of the equipment Cisco has to offer. Great to have Cisco on your resume! A lot of micro managing but thats to be expected at this point in your career. Decent pay but no benefits for interns.

Great for layer 1 and layer 2 troubleshooting but bad for when companies want you to have experience using ospf, eigrp, etc. Have to find someone who really wants to help you get your feet in the door once the experience is over

Pros
People in general is friendly and easy going.

Cons
The manager(s) do not know what the requirements of a job are, interview and offer positions that does not match what must be done at job. A total chaos of processes and workflows, very disorganized documentation, fragmented. Too many politicians and no actions to correct evident errors. A lot of time lost in meetings that are not important or relevant to the job. Manager doesn't make follow up and doesn't know how to assign tasks because are not aware of what Io do. For more than 3 months there never was possible to get a working place, resources and real assignment. It was a waste of time.

Advice to Senior Management
Educate themselves in effective management. Minimize the meeting time. Assign and balance work and tasks to the team. Respect and do follow up meetings.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Marketing Manager says "Great Benefits, Mediocre Management Decisions That is Leading to Poor Morale"

From Cisco Systems Marketing Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 30 Nov 2015

Pros
Excellent benefits (bonus structure, ESPP, PTO, Good work-life balance but it is up to you to set it and stick to it Great telecommuting options For the most part, good people at the individual level who just want to do good work in a positive manner Promotions and raises do come to those who fight for themselves Was able to grow career substantially but it needs to be under the right leaders. A poor manager stifles this

Cons
Disconnect between what the senior management (VP level) perceives and what is actually occurring within their org Frequent re-orgs means cutting great talent Changing directions and priorities make it a challenge to stick to one strategy for a sustaining period 401k match is good but could be better (currently at 4.5%) Cisco is a low/no growth company which means managing expenses to the tenth degree. This means budget cuts, lack of travel for customer engagements, no backfilling lost talent, etc.

From Cisco Systems Business Development Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 30 Nov 2015

Pros
When you are hired you have the feeling that you're the best professional in the world. You get a welcome letter saying that they just hire the cream of the cream, etc.

Cons
When fired, in my case was efective immediately without any reason or good justification even after good results and a very recent promotion.

Advice to Senior Management
Great company to work, innovation company, great people and very high level of professionals. Great benefits and environment.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Good Company, but Much Room for Improvement"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 29 Nov 2015

Pros
Good work/life balance. Employees are mature, reasonable, and professional for the most part. Good compensation and benefits. Company and senior leaders appear ethical. Some freedom to move laterally around the company.

Cons
Too much organizational shuffling is lowering productivity and morale. Too much emphasis placed on polished communication skills and politicking and not enough on results. Hierarchical management styles with lower grades not likely to contradict higher ups.

Advice to Senior Management
Provide avenues for high achievers to be promoted and recognized. Stability is also needed for many to feel fully vested in the company.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Program Manager says "Great Company, Hard Work."

From Cisco Systems Program Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Sun, 29 Nov 2015

Pros
You'll never get bored working at Cisco and there are always new opportunities to chose from. If you take advantage of the internal "Glide" program, you can transfer horizontally to another job role (such as from Engineer over to Project Manager). Not many companies offer that kind of flexibility.

Cons
The work is hard and the hours can be very long. The pay is on the high end of average for this industry, but you won't get rich off of your base pay. Cisco is a meritocracy where contribution is rewarded (both by peers and by managers). Also, if the company does well, the annual bonuses can be quite nice.

Advice to Senior Management
Give up on ACI. It's a doomed product that I don't think could be successful even if everything worked perfectly as documented.

Pros

Cons
Cisco wants to become a service company, so the work cultutre is degrading day by day, lots of internal politics related to project, work and promotion, if you are not political it may take upto 7 years to get a promotion.

Have to work in cube No free snacks Bulky laptops for interns

Pros
Autonomy if consistent performer Army of resources New products and services always being introduced Great network of partners Smart, quality, customer-oriented co-workers Wonderful team atmosphere

Cons
Politics of middle management Information management--"It's on the web." HR is absent--one of the most telling signs was that, outside of a few formal programs, there didn't seem to be much emphasis on personal development

Advice to Senior Management
Keep the good people. Partner with employees to help them achieve their career goals. Continue to acquire solid tech companies. Be more vocal in pushing a cyber security agenda.

Pros
Decent work culture, zeal for innovation and solve issues differently makes Cisco a very good place to work. Teams are equipped with multiple technical capabilities. There is a bit of initiation on the innovation just stared.

Cons
Felt that Cisco needs to pay some attention on it's people.If you are a new hire, you may not complain but people stay for more than 5-6 years are not happy with what Cisco offers. Should push for more innovative ideas and adapt problem solving skills.

Advice to Senior Management
Explore new opportunities and encourage teams to purse different technologies. Apart from solving customer problems alone, leave some space for innovation.

Pros
Cisco has its hand in a lot of pots so you're sure to find an area of work you're interested it. Furthermore, its an industry leader and a great name to have on your resume, especially as an intern. Great work life balance.

Cons
San Jose and the Bay in general are extremely expensive, expect most of your compensation to go towards room and board.

Great people with deep experience. Bench strength was phenomenal -- deep subject matter expertise in a broad array of capabilities. Mature org that meant it was rare to see a mandate without the resource plan to make it happen -- far different than many tech companies in that regard.

Cons
Going through a major re-org throughout most of my time there. I had three bosses and four roles in less than 18 months. Profesionally, that was invigorating but it didn't yeild as high a contribution that a bit more stability would have afforded.

Advice to Senior Management
John Chamber set a great course and a high bar. The next generation will need to be equally adept at pivoting the business as the speed of change keeps accelerating.

From Cisco Systems Sales Support Advisor (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 23 Nov 2015

Pros
One of the best ''schools'' in the world for new technologies. It was like a river of knowledge that just kept on flowing and flowing, and would never run dry.

Cons
Some people feel frustrated when they see you succeed and get better results than them. So they will do all they can do make your life miserable, including bullying you and say all sorts of lies to get others to dislike you as well. It takes a lot of strength of character to handle that and come away with your Dignity intact, but it's possible, because I did it.

Advice to Senior Management
Learn to treat employees as human beings, such as yourselves. Treat them like you would like to be treated and maybe you'll be surprised with the response.

Pros
great company with mart people! new leadership has big shoes to fill, that said - Mr Robbins knows exactly what he's dealing with and has a strong vision and support front he Board about what Cisco needs to do differently going forward, and lastly, i was the proudest employee when I worked for this company - in touch with the community and the humans that make Cisco strong, and Cisco takes and time and enables good things for its employees and the communities its in.

Cons
its a big company with some big company problems - and yes there are politics and BS that goes on - no different than most places. in my opinion, its an authentic place with a culture that has allowed people to have a POV and speak up about it without a problem if done productively. there have been lots of people changes since mr Robbins stepped in as CEO, good newws and some not so much.

Pros
you get a chance to work on advance technologies and with some great minds

Cons
Cisco keeps doing regular silent layoffs which make prevents CIsco from filling immigration petitions like Green Card. People keep waiting for years to get their PERM processed. So if you are looking for a sponsor to file GC for you then CIsco is not a place for you. Save your Big American Dream!

Advice to Senior Management
Fix the restructuring procedure and let employees, you hire, fulfill their American dreams. Don't jeopardize someones future.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Fri, 20 Nov 2015

Pros
Exciting company, you work for one of the best companies, strong market presence makes it fun to create content as great customers and business outcomes to include. Lot of flexibility, I work from home, love the freedom but I'm very productive. People you work with are very sharp and the best in the industry. Cisco is not a tech-first company as much as it was originally, very market focused.

Cons
Biggest downside is the unpredictability of having a job. I've been through a few layoffs, and recently got back into Cisco as a full-time contractor. They seem to like this arrangement so they don't have to pay all the benefits. But I find this aspect of it, plus the frequent layoffs, very disheartening. I keep waiting for the company to stabilize. Maybe with Chuck Robbins, the new CEO, it will.

Pros
Flex schedules and casual dress.

Cons
Pay below industry average; yearly lay-offs; NO ANNUAL RAISES (not even every other year); if your manager is in another geographic area, she/he won't be interested in you; if Cisco bought your company, LEAVE NOW, because they will soon ignore all logic and replace what works with their homogenous '1-size-fits-all' methodology and ultimately, get rid of everyone who worked at the purchased company - Count on it.

Pros
You get cisco routers at discount. Note it gets delivered after a week.

Cons
No work life balance. Not competent pay. Not competent in technology. Management is unclear of what is going on in company and don't care about the employees. HR department is not reachable or present and not helpful. Processes are as any other big company. Cisco is not a recognized brand name or brand name has fallen badly this is my experience with Cisco customers. By policy they fire employees every 6 months so as soon as you get hired please start looking for a job. Internal movement is almost impossible. Impossible to go onsite.

Pros
work life balance is good work from home can make it flexible good facilities and benefits

Cons
I won't recommend Cisco if you are on H1B. They will keep doing layoffs and they will be unable to file your PERM. Pay is not so great. Small or non existent pay raises

Advice to Senior Management
Poach some executives from the newer and cooler web companies to be better at making software. Cisco is still mostly a hardware company.

Great internship program for rising sophomores and juniors. Treat you like an adult and really want you to be successful at Cisco.

Cons
Not much exposure to interns in other departments. Also, if you want to experience different parts of the company you need to make that clear to your manager at the beginning so they can set up shadowing opportunities.

From Cisco Systems Intern - Hourly (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 18 Nov 2015

Pros
Cisco had a great collaborative culture. Every person I met was extremely helpful and wanted me to succeed. While all internships are at least partially geared towards the intern contributing something to the company, I found that at Cisco it was more geared towards making you want to work at Cisco. Instead of pushing me to my breaking point, this internship program made the summer an enjoyable one! The internship gave me the chance to shadow current employees and see what working at Cisco would actually be like, while having fun with coworkers and experiencing the company culture. There is also substantial freedom to move around in the company. Although I was interning in Sales, my boss encouraged me to shadow a coworker in finance, as I had voiced interest in that in the past. Cisco wants its workers to be happy with their job within Cisco, even if it means switching departments.

Cons
The company tends to be a little older than many tech companies today. Although this internship program is one of the ways they are trying to change that, it does make the culture a bit different from other tech companies.

From Cisco Systems MARKETING PROGRAM MANAGER (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 17 Nov 2015

Pros
Innovative, flexible, can be fun and collaborative, quality people, high standards, cutting edge technology. Opportunity to learn processes valuable for a resume. If you keep in mind you are a contractor, and will be moving on, it is easier to weather the uncertainty of the department and org. As a full time person, benefits are incredible!

Cons
It appeared to me that often politics instead of work ethic gets you promoted; the good ole boy network lives. Often reorgs leave folks in a quandary with no direction for months, contractors can be left out of knowledge loop due to status with no leadership. There seems to be a clear divide between the 'worker bees' and management. Often full time new hire interns did not do much work. Reorgs every 2 years and that is challenging and demotivating without leadership.

Advice to Senior Management
What if management executed their vision and the reorg all at the same time without leaving people and departments hanging without a clue of direction for months on end? I loved my job, but when reorg came, working was depressing for months before many of us left. I'm hopeful that Chuck can get a grip on the situation.

From Cisco Systems Technical Leader (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 16 Nov 2015

Pros
Work on some great technologies that truly are reshaping how people work and play.

Cons
Management and processes are not aligned with company objectives. Executives tell you to focus on quality. But, middle management tells you to focus on arbitrary dates and timelines. End result: fighting customer fires over and over again as quality does not match promises or expectation.s

Advice to Senior Management
Cut it out with the "Limited Restructuring". When employees keep fearing for their jobs, regardless of their performance, they spend too much time focusing on the wrong things. Don't expect loyalty from your employees if you can't be mutual.

Pros
Not much really, perhaps to mention everything I recall, only highlight the chance of working from home and getting some sort of gold plated resume by typing Cisco's name on it... that's it. Nothing else.

Cons
No career path at all. If you ever have the chance to get to work at cisco, do it and get the most out of it as long as it lasts. But as soon as you can, you better go to any other place since there's no chance for promotion nor being valued as an employee. Only cheerleaders get upgrades, the harder they perform on their toadying the better they get promoted. The place is overloaded with slacker sponges, specially in middle management, soaking up knowledge from interns, contractors and new-hires so they can work on their upgrades (being the only task you can name when describing many of the people inside). I even had the chance to talk to a senior manager once and he told me that in order to improve my visibility, I needed to do nothing worth anything for the company but needed to pretend to be 'always busy and always lovely', which made some sense some time later, when a lady managing the team I was in told us there is no need to give your best on your daily job, you only need to show your *shiny eyes* -- and even threatened those who didn't follow her teachings with downgrades or being thrown out the hen house. Basically if you want to become somebody at cisco, understand this place values no work, and working is something frowned upon: you will have a career path if you behave like a clown, capable enough to tamper sales figures. Otherwise, if you try to perform like a pro, they will isolate you until you are bored stiff and play along until you get lr'ed. My advise: better skip Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Grab your bucks now and run as if there's no tomorrow... the whole place is a bluff. A real time-bomb you might want to be far away from it, few months from now.

Good working culture, which includes flexible-work timings. Excellent and visionary top management. Employees' voice is heard irrespective of their designation/grade.

Cons
Sometimes, things may get caught up in bureaucracy, if one wants to implement a novel idea. Its a US-centric company - most of the strategic and critical decisions flow down from the HQ in USA. Talent differentiation doesn't happen which can be a huge let down for top performers.

Cisco has very high quality senior management. High ethics and Fair play. Overall the Customer first culture helps Cisco win in the market place.

Very employee friendly policies. and a winning culture.

Cons
Cisco like any large Global is an ocean with slack. People at middle ranks are beginning to loose their way. There is too much room for one to be a Cog, and too many overlay roles and functions.

Advice to Senior Management
Embrace more Command & Control. When you see slack, stop it

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Thu, 12 Nov 2015

Pros
- Good pay - Good leadership - Committed to employee mobility

Cons
- Too much politics; people don't work for the common goal but to justify their existence - a natural manifestation of Cisco's continuing lay-offs - Takes decisions without analyzing enough, and then reverses those same decisions later

Advice to Senior Management
Be more organized and ensure accountability is actually applied, rather than being used as a buzzword

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Thu, 12 Nov 2015

Pros
Cisco is a great place to learn, rack certifications, and grow both technical, soft, and business skills. And then move on, vertically or sideways.

Cons
It's a bureaucracy, with petty office politics. It's easy to get buried under work there. You won't get a promotion unless you know the right people, and are on the right projects (advancement is earned more from visibility rather than merit.)

Advice to Senior Management
Recognize and promote people on merit, not on back-stabbing internal politics which you call visibility.

Advice to Senior Management
Flatten the organization. The layer of middle management "fat" is very thick. Too much redundancy across business units. Company is too siloed.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Thu, 12 Nov 2015

Pros
Strong technology leaders Get to work on latest and greatest in networking Huge breadth of talent and experience and active projects locally Opportunities to move internally Plenty of customer engagement

Cons
Some antiquated processes Some antiquated tools Projects are not globally filtered and ordered so determining which project to work on and when can be chaotic. Lack of a deep support team means many customer issues make it back to the designers - this could be a Pro but not usually

Advice to Senior Management
Keep the environment agile and adapting to new tools, and methods Keep employees motivated by clearing away the overhead of getting designs and code completed.

renumeration and package training budget Cisco pay well and value their employees at a corporate level there is plenty of opportunity to be part of a great cohesive team

Cons
changes to leadership lack of direction managers at the BU level are seriously squeezed to perform and this forces them to behave in ways not aligned to the organisations beliefs

Advice to Senior Management
set a vision for the BU and evangelise it, trust your teams to deliver on it.

From Cisco Systems CSE (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 11 Nov 2015

Pros
A very storied and rich silicon valley company. To me, its all about your team and you manager. If you can have good folks in both regards - its an awesome place. Cutting edge on technology. Well respected. The leader. Good pedigree. Some opportunities to make money.

Cons
Too big. Should be three different companies (UC/Security/Enterprise Networking). Middle management still needs to be cleaned up - lots of ash and trash. Last manager was more in to managing up versus looking out for me or my teammates. Lots of lip service to careers and the ability to do different jobs. Managers usually earn their job by interviewing well and lining up connections to promote their advancement. Manager purposely did not support my efforts to earn CCIE.

Advice to Senior Management
Clean up management ranks.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 11 Nov 2015

Pros
There's a lot of opportunities at this enormous global company with fantastic benefits - but no one is going to hand hold you to develop your career. It's really easy to get paid well, work 9-5 and be at Cisco for a decade, if you want a mommy-track or low key job. If you want to learn, be challenged, move up fast, learn the org landscape, find the right sponsors and there are lots of interesting learning experiences to be had.

Cons
Political, big and slow in many parts of the org. Back channel negotiation and side discussions are required to smoothly get stuff done, and not doing so has career ramifications. That said, if you understand the landscape, you can do well. Had great experiences and career development, but ultimately I left because I wanted more direct impact than what I could see as a cog in the massive machine that is Cisco. That said, it was worth the tour of duty

Advice to Senior Management
Identify your high potentials below the Grade 13 cut off, you're losing the young ones with energy to faster, cooler places in droves!

Pros
there are no positives to be mentioned

Cons
One of the worst ever teams to be a part of, I cant speak for the whole company, but whatever i have heard from several teams points in a very negative direction, the management has a very nasty habit of culling its head count annually, you walk around assuming the worst about your job and then there is the constant nagging fear in the back of your head saying "will they fire me this time?" . But lets stick to CSTG support team more specifically the cspc support team, them management is extremely poor, there is absolutely no work life balance, there was one instance when the manager actually called me to ask where i was when i was working from home sick, there is an overwhelming atmosphere of micro management, where threats of firing is hurled in your direction(not directly of course but its always implied).....but lets assume for a second that all companies have this problem and I am just a disgruntled old employee.......The team that consists mostly of linux administrators are extremely extremely extremely poor technically, they have a feeling that no company will hire them owing to there poor skills and they are absolutely right ..nobody will hire them..... but this is not their fault the company overburdens them with the same monotonous work every single day which sometimes takes more than 10 hours to complete(which literally kills their personal life) ... they are not allowed to learn anything new, because they dont know what to learn(they are sorrounded by self acclaimed technical leads who are actually idiots with no technical skills and are incapable of teaching or advising the other engineers about any new technologies),obviously if you spend enough time around an idiot you end up being one. This company is not preparing you for the future, it is lead by a management team that is stuck in the past and will only lead you in the direction that will eventually destroy your career and leave you unsatisfied and unhappy.

Advice to Senior Management
i cannot give you any advise because of your incapability to take it....i know eventually you will only sink yourself, i only hope to god you don't take the Engineers who might actually have a future down with you....

Pros
Average government salaries are competitive with the private and nonprofit sectors. Pay can also increase fairly quickly for top candidates with strong education and experience. Federal benefits, including health insurance, retirement and vacation, are extremely competitive with, if not superior to, other sectors.

Cons
Where do you want to work and live? Whatever the answer, chances are you can find federal government work there. Most people think that federal government jobs are all in Washington, D.C., but in fact 84 percent of federal government jobs are outside of the D.C. area. More than 50,000 federal government employees work abroad.

From Cisco Systems HRUP Intern (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 9 Nov 2015

Pros
Decent compensation, awesome projects, excellent exposure to everyone in the HR organization, SJC was an awesome place to work (lots of fun things to do there).

Cons
Housing is very expensive. If you don't have a hook up in SJC, you are probably not going to make any money due to the steep housing costs. I stayed with a member of my church you let me stay with him for $700 a month. Dirt cheap. It pays to know people.

Advice to Senior Management

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "View from a current employee"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Sun, 8 Nov 2015

Pros
Can work from home. Management leaves you to do your job for the most part. There is a strict unwritten rule not to lose it (aka, yelling at employees, writing rude emails and etc...) no matter how hot the subject . It will not happen right away but, they will isolate and layoff those people. A very good culture requirement.

Cons
On call 24/7. Things that are normal for a big company aka watching management change direction randomly, people sending pointless emails to the entire company. You just ignore requirements and endless demands take mandatory training. At the end of the day they realize that you are very valuable in the customer's eyes and that is all that matters.

Pros
Is a really good environment to grow. All the people is always open to help you in whatever you need. Been part of the Cisco Sales Associate Program is an incredible opportunity to learn a lot in world class training and certification materials. Is great to work here.

Cons
There is nothing wrong with this position, you get paid for studying and with pretty good benefits. Sometimes you need to study in weekends and after work, that can be a problem if you have a family to take care of

Advice to Senior Management
Keep investing in the education of your employees. Is key for success. I think that will be great if the company could provide new employees the opportunity to meet people around the world in a more regular basis.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Wed, 4 Nov 2015

Pros
Good overall benefits, flexible work from home policy (a necessity given one of the cons below), a great name for your resume

Cons
Feels like an old company trying unsuccessfully to change to a younger feel. Lots of politics, especially around headcount, which leads to continuous employee moves making it hard to move up. Constant change that leads to yearly layoffs. Limited visibility from management on the changes and moves that makes it difficult to effectively do your job. Open office space with no assigned space makes going into the office almost pointless and unproductive, since there's not enough rooms for you to make the calls you'll be on all day. Pay inequality, in certain situations, that's impossible to get fixed without leaving and coming back.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Intern says "Worldwide Sales Internship"

From Cisco Systems Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 4 Nov 2015

Pros
This was one of the best internships I have ever had. I have had experiences in several other sectors and internships and this was, hands down, the best summer job I have ever had. The work we did was nothing like any other internship. We did meaningful research, presentations, and strategic planning. Cisco taught us how to be effective doing consultative tech research and planning. I learned an incredible amount about business, networking, and strategy. On top of that we had a great amount of exposure to the senior management of the company. The CEO himself spoke to our class, and a lot of the senior staff opened up to questions and provided advice on how we could be successful in careers. Cisco really hooked it up. We had great out of office - sponsored - bonding activities that was a great for getting to know our coworkers. They also paid for our housing! We were able to live in one of the best apartments in Boston - at no cost! Cisco really put together an unbelievable summer experience. I learned a ton, did great work, met some unbelievable people, lived in a palace, and had it all sponsored by Cisco. This was it. I highly recommend this internship. Also - this is a feeder program into one of the best jobs in the industry, and they want to hire you, so ... it is a great way to get your career going early on. And if you choose to go somewhere else, Cisco has a powerful name that will help you anywhere.

Cons
I was turned off by the internships name of "Sales" - I was a computer engineer in college and never thought I would go into sales. This is really not a sales role - there is not cold calling. This is business consulting and account management with a focus on technology. So I think the name, with sales in it, should be changed.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep doing whatever you are doing. They were constantly looking to improve and make the internship better. They reached out to great kids and put together a great program.

More diversity and career opportunities look after people you have stop redundancies which are used to get rid of one person and hire two on a lower wage. Stop managing up and manage team

Consolidate now. Split off the software business to sink or swim on its own. Don't wait for Wall Street to extract its pound of flesh. Flush the lines and instigate a more innovation driven - less sales centric culture.

Pros
First and foremost: the people! The amount of training and support is phenomenal. Going into the CSAP program I had high expectations. 3 months in, every single one of them was exceeded: some of the best instructors, IT tech courses that are geared toward the practical and relevant for the job, lab always open for "getting the hands dirty", sales training made fun. Did I mention the people? Everyone form my CSAP co-workers to experienced systems engineers to management (at all levels) is really supportive and approachable. Also, I had the chance to interact with people outside of my local office and they did not seem far at all. The pay is great, there is relocation support, I am happy with the insurance provided.

Cons
The training program is very engaging and intense. If not careful, maintaining a work-life balance becomes a struggle.

Advice to Senior Management
From my experience so far, feedback is valued and taken into account so: keep doing what you are doing.

Pros
AMAZING culture - had heard about this in the internship interviews but really saw it come to life, everyone here is excited to be here which was not the case at other large IT companies I looked at Right Direction - Cisco is extremely well positioned in the market while the industry is going through massive consolidation (i.e., Dell/EMC) Incredible Benefits - Great pay, onsite fitness and health center with wide variety of doctors, birthday's off, solid PTO, stock options, etc.

Cons
There is a lot to learn on the tech side as a sales rep as Cisco is in almost every market, but it does become manageable after a couple months.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep investing in security and software, great job with 'The People Deal!'

From Cisco Systems Senior Account Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 2 Nov 2015

Pros
Salary, sales commission program + benefits. Brand and name has an excellent reputation, great talent working for the company worldwide. Opportunities to grow for ambitious people.

Cons
Staff moves around a lot, very political inside large companies. Lots of internal selling to make with different levels of people to move things forward. Too slow at launching new products or technologies, smoke and mirror syndrome is hurting the sales team credibility (finance and legal weigh more than marketing and sales). Lay offs are inevitable (almost each year) - highly competitive culture among staff due to this pressure.

Advice to Senior Management
Less bureaucratie to move things faster (from product development to approval of deals). Walk the talk with involvement, communication and empowerment of your sales teams.

Pros
Still finding the pros from past 2.5 years

Cons
At the time of offer letter, HR told that the work type will be Development but its totally Sustenance(Bug Fixing). Cisco is not doing good it doesn't have enough money to give hikes to their at least 80% of their employee. Even many of the employees are in CISCO Bangalore who doesn't get the hike for past 2.5 years. If employee asked their managers or higher management they try to scare it by saying that they will fire you and put the bad remarks in your relieving letter. As every year, there is a culture in Cisco to fire the employees. So manager take benefits of it and as there are few networking companies so they are always try to harassing the employees. If anyone joined, managers directly told them that you will not get the hike even if you performed well because you switched the company so you get good amount of hike in comparison to the previous employer. Dirty politics in Cisco. No career growth.

Advice to Senior Management
Higher management is worst. Many of the employees don't know who are the HR for their Business Unit.

Pros
It's a good company with exposure to some good technology. I enjoy the focus on staying at the top of most industries, although this is beginning to decline.

Cons
This company treats its employees poorly recently. I have had issues with my manager, with changes in the organization, with low pay, and with terrible company acquirements that leave us lower than where we were/

Advice to Senior Management
Try to focus on your employees, and on your interns? It's not hard. A lot of managers go through the Adecco program instead of the internship program; find them, remove them. They have no idea how to follow a process.

Pros
Cisco has very competitive pay and a strong brand. I have (mostly) high-quality co-workers. Senior management (on my team anyway) does not micro-manage, employees are empowered.

Cons
Cisco is a very large company and you can sometimes feel lost in the fray. Communication and cooperation between different business units could certainly be better.

Advice to Senior Management
My biggest desire would be that we establish a clear set of goals and truly pursue them to completion....less changes of direction, shifts in senior leadership and annual re-org's...

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 30 Oct 2015

Pros
Cisco is fast paced environment and a fantastic talent pool and will only enhance your career and CV. You have a freedom to shape your role as long as it yields results expected. A very personal company and will go out of their way to help you with both work and non-work related issues.

Cons
There are many employees in Cisco you need to do more than your day job to get recognised and promoted.

Advice to Senior Management
Listen more to your team and what they see in the field. Customer focus need to be driven from SEs, to BUs more effectively. BUs need to listen to customers that how they'll continue to make great products and address the market needs.

Pros
Most people you'll work with are impressive, professional, and approachable. The company is so large that it's easy to move around - as long as you know someone. Having the flexibility to work from home when needed is terrific.

Cons
Annual layoffs at the beginning of the fiscal year are now an accepted part of the culture. The only time the email stops is during the shut down in late Dec. Leadership ranges from great in some organizations to virtually non-existent in others.

Incredible opportunity to expand your horizons, learn and innovate. You are supported to try new approaches. Great teamwork.

Cons
Not really a con, but you need to want to work hard. The rewards are there, yet you often work long hours. People are right there along with you.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 28 Oct 2015

Pros
Great environment, beautiful campus, friendly people, huge cubicle space, smooth and easy communication via Jabber and WebEx, not too stressful, up-to date tools/software that makes work so much easier. There is at least one huge event every year (Cisco Rocks!) and many fun social gatherings biweekly near the site I worked at (site 5).

Cons
Slow paced work in the sense that you can't get your work done until someone is finished with their work. On a daily basis, I am mostly waiting 2-3 hours for someone to finish their work so I can work on my part of the project. It was great at first, but after a while I found it rather annoying and I didn't find myself as productive as I wanted to be.

Advice to Senior Management
Went in for a performance review and my manager tells me great and I pretty much told me I should gauge myself. What kind of performance review is that?! How am I supposed to determine how well I am doing in terms of performance if I don't get any productive feedback?

From Cisco Systems Marketing Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Wed, 28 Oct 2015

Pros
I was at Cisco for four and a half years and left a couple of months ago. Here's my perspective: - Great company to have on your resume. - They offer fantastic work-life balance and flexible work options. I worked from home almost the entire time I was there and loved it. They provide the tools you need to work from anywhere. - Excellent benefits; employee health insurance premiums are really low. - They employ some incredibly smart people, and I believe that the new CEO is going to do great things. - It's a fantastic company for engineers; they are the star employees.

Cons
- They have a difficult history of annual layoffs, and the dust is still settling with the new CEO in place and the changes he's making to the organization. - Cisco is not generous with merit increases and promotions are difficult to come by. - Cisco is a behemoth of a company. As such, processes for getting anything done are complex and slow. - Don't expect a lot of handholding as you start your job. Cisco prides itself on being a "self service" company. That means you have to figure out how to get things done.

Advice to Senior Management
Live up to the promises you've made about doing away with stack-ranking employees; don't overlook the "workhorses" in favor of the people who always seem to get the plum, high visibility assignments. There is a lot of great work being done, most of which never gets recognized.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 28 Oct 2015

Pros
Great benefits, good work. The company is a market leader in its line of business. The networking industry is under pressure due to SDN and white box. Cisco is trying to keep up with the new technologies. So there is a lot of good work and learning opportunities.

Cons
Due to the race to build new technologies there is a lot of work that needs to be done in short time. Consequently work life balance is impacted.

Advice to Senior Management
Be cognizant of the life of employees outside of work and plan projects and work accordingly especially for employees with family and children.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 27 Oct 2015

Pros
Lots of money and lots of bodies thrown at difficult problems. Some reasonably forward thinking from senior management. Their product is still their main benefit. Good reputation for the devices and stable operation make for a great product.

Cons
Too much money hides a multitude of middle manager sins and contractors providing no benefit and getting in the way of technical projects. Too many good "red badges" are not motivated to stay with the company by being hired full time. There seems to be some selectivity in the hiring of the IT teams that doesn't seem aligned to competence and as such, the IT support outside of mainline tools is ... challenging.

Advice to Senior Management
Review the performance against some KPI for contract staff.

Pros
The company offers great projects to work on. If you are a full time employee, it can really be a good decision to work for Cisco.

Cons
The treatment towards the contractors is very rude and unhuman. Such behaviors do nothin gmore than ruin company reputation.

Advice to Senior Management
The management should ensure righteous behavior towards contractors. Current situation on contractors is too bad.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior Program Manager says "Contracting for 10 years"

From Cisco Systems Senior Program Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 26 Oct 2015

Pros
Like any job, if you can find a good manager and a good team to work on, you will like your work. Being a contractor provides the advantage that you should be able to not buy into political positioning since you are not an employee and don't have reviews that affect your salary and promotions. Of course, diplomacy is always a key. Hopefully, the changes that the new CEO is making will elevate the company back to the industry status that it had during the boom.

Cons
As at any company, employees are sometimes promoted to management positions who should really remain as individual contributors or who should have more management training in order to make the transition. Otherwise, micromanagement becomes an issue for people like contractors who work autonomously. Employees can spend more time projecting their jobs than focusing on completing their work. Yet, that is why contractors get hired - to get the work done.

Advice to Senior Management
Ensure that only qualified individual are promoted or that they are trained appropriately. Don't promote to just get employees who are barriers out of the way of progress.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 26 Oct 2015

Pros
Pay, Bonuses, 401K matching, ESPP, medical, dental, vision, tuition reimbursement, internal training programs.

Cons
Constant layoffs and in fighting between departments. It's not what you know, it's who you know to survive and move up.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on taking care of your good employees and not just your shareholders. Practice what you preach including being transparent. Take the improvement areas from the customer surveys and act upon them in a timely manner.

Pros
Flexible scheduling and informal dress code.

Cons
Cisco consistently pays less than average, doesn't give raises except fort promotions, which are rare, lays off good people every year and Cisco is besieged by a choking inner bureaucracy.

Advice to Senior Management
Management at Cisco doesn't EVER take advice from those in the actual know, so why bother?

Pros
The services division attracts a high caliber of talent to deliver a complex portfolio of service offerings. Getting better at solution selling.

Cons
Large size of organizations slows decision strategic decision making and execution. Not proactive with exchanging talent across organizational silos to handle shifting business demand.

From Cisco Systems Software QA Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 26 Oct 2015

Pros
Good for work life balance. I never had too much work. * to 4 job, sometimes had to attend interviews at night. Awesome campus. AC innova cabs for transport. Loads of events to win goodies. Training sessions at company's cost.

Cons
Everything is in manager's hand. If you are in good terms with manager, you get good work, otherwise end up with junk work always. Very tough to get promotions. Salary hike is almost never. If you are joining, negotiate a very good package, joining bonus etc while joining itself. If you take sabbatical leave, you need to find a team on your own and need to go through 6+ rounds of tough interview again, though you are still an employee.

Advice to Senior Management
Use employees skills properly, everyone might not perform every time. Give a chance to prove the capabilities.

From Cisco Systems IT Analyst (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Mon, 26 Oct 2015

Pros
Great cultural diversity, company perks in terms of dental cover and stock plans, etc.

Cons
Cisco is still built on the 'progression is based on time served, not merit' model, where the longer you've been here, the more you'll get. For young people starting out, out-performing their colleagues, not the greatest motivation to have. Also, for new fields, it's harder to define your career. Avoid if you're young.

Advice to Senior Management
Realise the market is changing, and if you're really for talent retention/management - then change your age old performance management system.

Pros
Many of the long time employees that I met were kind and genuine and always interested in helping me.

Cons
Cisco has a very "drink the Kool-Aid" kind of vibe. Many employees are loyal to the point of obsession which often gets in the way critical thinking about what and how the company is actually doing. This made me feel like a bit of an outsider.

Pros
I am never ever bored. There are so many resources & opportunities available 24/7 - a veritas of new ideas...

Cons
TAC Engineer must maintain multiple internal responsibilities simultaneously while ensuring satisfaction in resolution of customer cases; all the while, increasing one's skill-set continuously. Multitasking is an understatement and long days are the norm. Although I enjoy this type of environment, it is demanding and should be considered - else your team suffer's!

Advice to Senior Management
I am encouraged by the follow through with the goals Cisco has in place. Keep that spirit going!

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer IV (Current Employee) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Sat, 24 Oct 2015

Pros
Good Health Insurance, Dental, Vision Benefits. HSA Health Plan is very good Good 401k Match Onsite Gym is Awesome in San Jose Onsite Doctors and Pharmacy (15% discount) provide most common services Bonus Structure is very good in the Compensation. Many folks get fantastic target bonus % and dollar amount if Cisco performs good in the last quarter. IT Services are Good. Latest version of Thinkpads and MacBook Pros and Latest version of Software used across organization.

Cons
- Engineering Organization is one of the worst in the the industry. You will definitely not get a good job outside of Cisco if you stay for many years. You will forget coding and you will not learn any good practices or gain knowledge outside of Cisco specific technologies. Do not stay here for more than 3-4 years. - Hiring Standards in Engineering is one of the lowest. Most engineers follow bad coding practices and do not have fundamental computer science knowledge. - Outdated Processes and Tools and it takes weeks to commit a simple code change. - Unit Testing Framework is one of the worst in the field. A single line code change needs to be only tested on the real platform and it can take days to build, load image and test it on real device. - Development Test Engineers are one of the worst in the Silicon Valley - They do not understand software and are only focused on filing x number of bugs since their performance is tied to this metric. - Still riding on the innovations done 25 years ago. No Innovation Happening. Many smaller and mid-size companies are innovating and moving fast. Many smart people have already left. - 99% of Engineering Management and Engineers are from only one sub-continent in the world. There is no diversity. - 75% of Technical Leads are Arrogant, Rude and do not do any sort of technical work. They act like managers and talk loudly and don't do real work. They either got there because they act like yes-men to their directors or they were either a close buddy of them in a previous company. - Extreme Politics - Nepotism and Cronyism run rampant. Impossible to get promoted without playing politics and feeding to the ego of their Directors. Promotions are not based on merit or technical work. There is no transparency in Performance Reviews. - Lack of Recognition of Any Kind. Only director's favorites get any RSUs and Awards and everyone else are treated like slaves. - Technical Leads get credit for delivering features even if the don't write a single line of code or contribute anything. - 95% of 1st Line Managers and 2nd Managers should be fired. They are extremely corrupt, inhuman and one of the worst people managers. They are neither technically good nor good people managers. Most people came in to Cisco as Contractors with Fake Resumes and became managers claiming x years of experience. They play politics and favoritism and outright lie to the face of employee. In Summary, if you ever dream of becoming a good software/hardware engineer, do not come here. If you are type of person from a country in Asia where you can stab your peers and stomp on them get ahead, you can survive here very well. Be warned! You cannot get a good job in a Startup or other places even remotely like Google if you stay in Cisco for long. Many employers in Silicon Valley know that Engineers from Cisco do not do any coding and only do the talking like they invented TCP/IP...

Advice to Senior Management
You should be ashamed of yourself to come to work every day. Do not talk about innovation and great culture if you know very well none of that is true. Do not Play Politics and Favoritism. The only way to save Cisco is to uproot the entire 1st and 2nd Line Managers and re-hire from places where they do real engineering

Pros
Its a great place to learn if you are starting your career. Lots of freedom and no micro management

Cons
if you are a red badge they treat you like bad/ s.h.i.t .. Dont trust anyone even your closest friend in the job because they can stab you back. I dont recommend to work here if you have a family that depends on you anything can happen

Advice to Senior Management
Contractors are weigh knowledgeable thank employees. Better treatment to contractors since they keep the company making money. Managers are too proud

Subject:	A Cisco Systems IT Director says "Great place to learn, not a place to stay"

From Cisco Systems IT Director (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sat, 24 Oct 2015

Pros
Worked there for over 10 years. They have a great flexible working schedule in most job roles. Lots of learning opportunities. Global company with a global presence. Great place to start a career right out of college.

Cons
The company values management. Individual contributors who do most of the work are not valued, are given no equity, and promotions are few and far between. They'll tell you there is no money for raises for hard working individual contributor, then a month later several vice presidents will be promoted to senior vice president. This happened over and over when Chambers was CEO. Layoffs are constant (called limited restructurings). In their IT department, where I spent part of my time, they push out anyone who tries to innovate or disrupt. The entire IT organization is run by the same people who've been there since 2000. The broken reward system made it impossible for me to keep my best workers.

Advice to Senior Management
Get rid of the bloated middle management layers. Completely reboot the IT department. Develop compensation programs for individual contributors that actually compete with the rest of silicon valley, because you're going to need those individual contributors in order to compete, much less win.

From Cisco Systems Team Leader (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Sat, 24 Oct 2015

Pros
Amazing facility. Employee benefits are excellent. Flexible working hours. Option to work from home.

Cons
Not exciting work for atleast Java. Not a true Agile shop. When tried to escalate issues in project to onsite scrum master, the offshore manager and leads were not happy. Feedbacks are neither encouraged nor considered. Managers come up with inefficient, complicated, very artificial, not so practical or friendly process for team building. They hardly understand that it does not add any value to the member / team / company. Too many incompetent contractors continue because of Manager preferences.

Advice to Senior Management
Managers need to be made practical and sensible when creating or adopting process. Managers need to be trained to accept feedback and introspect. Please train team on Agile and especially Managers.

Pros

Cons
The corporate headquarters are in San Jose, and Seattle is a small branch office. At times the reasons behind decisions made in San Jose were not clear to the Seattle staff.

Pros
Pays well. Excellent benefits and lots of perks (including local gym). High integrity. Very flexible (work from home at times)

Cons
Constant layoffs. Company is going thru a transformation and several people have been laid off over the last few years. Managers do not work as hard, and keep their jobs. Engineers are usually those that end up being laid off.

Advice to Senior Management
Get more involved in the day-to-day activities of engineering. Management could actually be more proactive in terms of helping engineers relocate to other departments/teams before giving layoff termination to employees.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Software Engineering Intern says "Software Engineering Intern @ Cisco"

From Cisco Systems Software Engineering Intern (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 21 Oct 2015

Pros
Great training; Cisco employees are often real domain experts in their fields. The company throws lots of events for interns. Flexible, can work from home. People are friendly. Good place to go for first internship to learn lots about a crucial area (networking), not a great place to go to work on production features and have a big impact.

Cons
Pay per hour is 1/2 of what the top industry players pay! It's also been 6 weeks since my internship ended and they haven't gotten back to anyone in my intern cohort about return offers - HR is overwhelmed. It's an older company, so culture is a little stale/unexcited. Work from home policy makes for an empty/dead office sometimes.

Advice to Senior Management
Upper management seems to have a good handle on market transitions and places to take the company, but their excitement and vision is not getting to ordinary engineers.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior Technical Leader says "Too much politics"

From Cisco Systems Senior Technical Leader (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 21 Oct 2015

Pros
Good salary and benefits

Cons
Politics Top level is focused on arranging chairs and work place than work itself No product ownership with the recent change in structure

Advice to Senior Management
Was recently affected by limited restructuring and the reason given was "he knows Linux" and hence "he can get a job" while other less performing individuals are kept safe. I was the best performer in my team. The management is too focused on cutting the head count than getting the product on time and in good quality. Lack of ownership at the top level.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer IV (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 18 Oct 2015

Pros
An excellent company to learn routing, switching and computer networks. Interesting work. Many opportunities to learn and apply technology. Cisco's following in the Networking field is widespread and equal to none, making it a very nice addition to the resume.. -Many opportunities to innovate. Good compensation, Good benefits, A flexible work environment.

Cons
Recently there have been too many senseless changes in direction causing turmoil. Too many layers of middle managers and vice presidents imposing their own personal agendas on the development and engineering groups,

Advice to Senior Management
Keep your eye on the ball. Avoid wasteful reorganisation which might impact design and product support. Sometiimes re-org is necessary (by product or by function) but don't change direction 180 degrees at every turn and back lest it impact product quality and supportability.

Advice to Senior Management
Better task distribution. Some of the colleagues are constantly buried with wip. Better policy for writing documentations can be nice also.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior IT Program Manager says "A lifetime career in technology"

From Cisco Systems Senior IT Program Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Thu, 15 Oct 2015

Pros
Very easy to move around internally between, engineering, development, IT and other functions. One can build their career and move upwards, there are a lot of resources one can leverage to seek a mentor, network internally and build relationships.

Cons
Too big and too bureacratic, sometimes gives the feeling you are working in government, takes a lot of time to convince and do the right thing. Despite the soundbites, management only likes quick wins and their career focus. As a result people management is often overlooked in place of technology management.

Advice to Senior Management
The pervading view of every employees are responsible for their development needs a lot of support from management and proper guidance.

Pros
It is a good company to work for, if you have a good manager and it really depends on that. Healthcare benefit were good, but cost went up every year. Did like that they were very ethical.

Cons
Cafeterias were expensive with very little flavor. Annually lay offs ruined moral. Lack of loyalty to employees. Other then the coffee, they always seemed to be trying to cut employee perks.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Thu, 15 Oct 2015

Pros
The projects you get and how you work on them largely depends on what business unit you end up on and who your manager and mentor are. Some will give you specific tasks and/or ways to do them, others will give you more opened ended objectives and/or leave it up to you how you want to do them. Quite a bit of freedom

Cons
The work culture is somewhat different from that of the other bay area companies. I would say Cisco's workforce is, on average, much older than those of Google, etc. and as a result, it's much more serious and less "fun".

Advice to Senior Management
Not the most challenging projects are given to interns as it depends on the needs of manager and also the duration. So you might not necessarily get what your interested in. But one thing at Cisco is you learn a lot with respect to networks so I enjoyed that

From Cisco Systems Information Technology (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Thu, 15 Oct 2015

Pros
Great Benefits and Bonus. People are hard workers and goal setters. Lazy people are not kept around. ESPP is a pretty awesome program. High Ethical Standards. I've worked at jobs where Integrity and ethics were talked about but the company did not act accordingly. Time and time again I am impressed with Cisco's Integrity and Ethics.

Cons
401k matching could be a little higher. Giving it a 4 star rating because the 401k matching is a pretty big deal to me. Since we do not get a pension, then somewhere around 6-8% 100% match would be a lot better. Other then that the Benefits are pretty awesome for me. I cannot speak for those with dependents if the benefits are better or worse then other companies.

Advice to Senior Management
Connected Rewards are an awesome way of giving feedback to employees. Along with Employees giving feedback to each other. I would encourage Management to use it more often and also recommend employees recognizing each other when they go above and beyond what is required. I wish we could use them for Red Badge Employees too. Some Red Badges do a fantastic job and it would be nice to reward them. I would like to see 6-8% 100% 401k match.

From Cisco Systems Business Analyst (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 14 Oct 2015

Pros
Large company with the opportunity to experience different aspects of working for a technology company and a Fortune 100 company. Depending on your manager, you can have cool opportunities to take ownership of projects.

Cons
Because the company is transitioning from hardware to services, they have other (arguably greater concerns) then creating a coherent program for college new hires.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on professional development opportunities for employees and encourage managers to not stand in the way of those who want to enhance their careers.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior Director says "New Leadership Has Some Glaring Weaknesses"

From Cisco Systems Senior Director (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 14 Oct 2015

Pros
Cisco is a solid, steady, if somewhat un-interesting company in terms of growth. It's sheer size and breadth will help it win many market segments. In mid-2015 it began the transition to a new leadership team at the c-level and then downward, as it replaced its CEO for the first time in 20 years and the new CEO plus his new c-level leaders (CIO, CTO, CMO, CDO, etc.) are all refreshing their leadership teams. Cisco has a good strategy and intends to focus on the hot topics du jour (mobile, digital, data / analytics, cloud...).

Cons
Cisco is spread across so many diverse topics that it is difficult to imagine it leading any one of them, let alone all of them. In particular it has some serious deficiencies in the new leadership team. The new CMO is particularly weak and has surrounded herself with second-rate leaders - bets are rampant within the company that she will not last more than 12-18 months in the job. Likewise, the new CDO (digital) has little experience of digital, has never been in such a high-profile and critical role in the past, and while he talks a good game, just a bit of scratching shows that he's mostly talk and no ability to execute. Other areas are stronger, such as COO and CIO. But watch for gaps and weakness in key leadership areas that are certain to delay the company's leadership or ability to execute for about 2 more years.

Advice to Senior Management
Re-think key weak spots in the leadership (c-level) team including CDO and CMO - and if serious about leading in these or other areas, then back it up with more than talk and promises and vision without execution.

Pros
company values (integrity, customer first, giving back etc), industry leading, great coworkers, work life balance, salary

Cons
reorganizations and layoffs are common, hard to get traction and focus on priorities when they are ever changing.. Pushing out seasoned folks to make room for early in career... No one feels safe... Compensation/benefits are falling behind peers...

Advice to Senior Management
People Deal feels like a way to get rid people with no performance paper trail... Not having the positive impact you think it is...

From Cisco Systems Intern - Hourly (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 14 Oct 2015

Pros
Really friendly staff. Employees get cubicles, with more social work-spaces available during the day. Management frequently converses with employees. Company makes an effort to keep employees in the loop on where the entire company is headed and what kind of difference the employees are making. Great compensation for an internship.

Cons
Even though this is a security internship, we spent the first half of the summer on a software engineering project. We did do more security related projects towards the end, but it would have been nice to be doing security from the beginning.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep doing what you are doing! My experience in Knoxville was so pleasant that it's hard to recommend any new advice. The communication was strong, the projects were fair, and the overall morale of the interns was very positive.

Pros
Decent work/life balance, good benefits

Cons
The Leadership seems to know where they want to go but does not know how to get there. Job rotation is encouraged but not rewarded. Lots of politics and bureaucracy to the point of making it difficult to get work done

Advice to Senior Management
Figure out a way to retain and hire individuals with a leadership mindset. Place these people in decision making roles. Reward those that delight customers as opposed to those that delight internal stake holders.

From Cisco Systems Analyst (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Mon, 12 Oct 2015

Pros
As a contractor, work totally remote to mitigate the "challenge" of being treated as "invisible" by Cisco full time employees.

Cons
Contract job descriptions that do not match the reality when you start; Inconsistent communication, feedback and direction by Cisco mid-level management; Contract work used by Cisco staff who "make it their own" giving no credit and creating false impressions to upper management.

Advice to Senior Management
Clean up your inconsistent practices (varies by BU) towards contract workers that give you one of the worst reputations in Silicon Valley. Your management does not have to be indifferent, insensitive and show contemptuous disrespect towards talented contract workers. Some day each of you could be in the same position and many contractors would find it hard to share your pain.

Advice to Senior Management
Get real. There's a tremendous amount of talent out there that's over 40 years old. You aren't twitter, you aren't google, you aren't amazon. You reward devotion, quality work and loyalty with some arbitrary comments about how you're not adding value because you haven't learned a new technology (even though you've been working 50 hours a week) just shows that they've become GE. It's not a mystery why they're no longer near the top of the "Best Places to Work" surveys.

From Cisco Systems Account Manager (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Thu, 8 Oct 2015

Pros
Great culture and technology. Cisco is a very driven but also caring culture. I loved the time I spent there and it was very hard to leave.

Cons
As an account manager, it is very hard to build a long term business because you have a limited number of accounts and are given a growth goal every year on the same set of accounts. After a couple of years, it becomes impossible to meet the number with the same set of customers. Even though Cisco has a large portfolio of solutions, not all of these drive large sales volume. This comp structure model drives folks to change territories or roles about every 2 years or so which makes it difficult to build long-lasting customer relationships.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer III (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Thu, 8 Oct 2015

Pros
* Lot of new things to learn. * Scale is huge, big customers. * Great courses are offered to keep skill up to date. * Good benefits - Health Insurance, 401K match, PTOs (1 on your birthday). * Few great minds around to leverage the knowledge.

Cons
* Dirty politics, VP changes then he brings all his people and let go great minds. * Lay Offs and Lay Offs, bad hiring policy. * Average Compensation. * Really bad managers who are not technically sound, how can this happen in a product company.

Advice to Senior Management
Cisco is just great and has the name which will last for sure. However please stop the bad hiring policy and dont randomly lay off great people who are the real assets of the company. Please make sure atleast the first level managers are technically sound. Revisit the compensation structure its definitely not on par with others in Bay Area now.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 7 Oct 2015

Pros
Decent benefits, nice pay, great people to work with

Cons
Politics, and job security. Due to local employment regulations in my country, contractors cannot renew a contract. Hence my manager requested for a regular conversion, and was approved by VP, but the conversion did not fall through. Cisco has NO idea who to hire/keep. A single account that I deployed in Thailand provided our sales team with enough information to upsell an additional 132 million USD in products, and another 2 million USD in services. I deployed many impossible accounts throughout Asia, and significantly improved all metrics and performances across the the region. The new budgeting control guy still had his doubts, and decided to just pick another contractor and train him from the ground up. Great idea.

Advice to Senior Management
You need a better system to evaluate who needs to stay and who doesn't. Also, I'm not sure about other Cisco Services, but your product management for SNTC is not good. Some examples include: major, super obvious bugs in the program "after" release. Improper or non existent training until a long time has passed since a service goes live. No clarity when it comes to issues raised either internally or externally. No sense of ownership, even when our VSEM is to make the end user happy

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Software Engineering Intern says "Overall Positive Internship"

From Cisco Systems Software Engineering Intern (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 6 Oct 2015

Pros
Full-time employees are more than happy to help; they seem to appreciate young blood in the office. Very flexible work hours/days; if you have to miss a day or two, managers are very flexible. Company makes an honest effort to socialize you with fellow interns.

Cons
Pay is nothing to write home about, at least for an internship in the Bay Area. Intern events are probably the only significant socializing you'll ever do; most full-timers only come into work and then immediately go home. Projects are typically a very small, minute component in an otherwise enormous system; no "cool factor" and the skills you learn don't seem to be transferable. Projects can also be mind-numbing, such as writing a series of JUnit tests or making several SQL calls to a server.

Advice to Senior Management
There's really nothing a lone manager or set of managers can do to remedy my complaints. While Cisco has pretty great full-time benefits and a very flexible work-life balance, the culture lends itself to employees being isolated and non-social. It's a great company to work for if you have a family, but for young people looking to build relationships with fellow employees, it's sub par.

Working for Cisco was a great experience. Opportunities to learn and grow. Good compensation and benefits. Some good leaders in place. Flexible and remote work opportunities. It is a benefit to have Cisco on your resume as having worked there.

Advice to Senior Management
Walk the talk. Make sure people are prepared for leadership when put into those roles and what their responsibility is. Hold them to it.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Sat, 3 Oct 2015

Pros
Been around for a long time, not going anywhere soon.

Cons
Too big to fail? This place has a reputation, and well deserved, for hiring contractor/consultants for a year and letting them go for any small reason irrespective of how valuable they are to the program or project. Many regular employees just punching the clock and collecting check but not really adding real value. Lots of management who has "survived" many years simply by being hard nosed, right or wrong. Has evolved into the BIG company that does not change direction well and has a difficult time attracting and keeping top engineering talent. Many people in power dont know much about technology except buzz words. Small wonder losing top software talent to startups doing much more and rewarding employees with actual rewards, not just pat on back.

Advice to Senior Management
find some real intelligent engineering minds to run the operations, not a bunch of people who have simply been around awhile and have never done actual engineering work.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Account Manager says "Account Manager"

From Cisco Systems Account Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sat, 3 Oct 2015

Pros
Great, broad product family, TAC and Engineering Support is world class. The company is customer and sales focused, so if you are on an account team, you can do what is needed to build win-win relationships with your client. There are a ton of opportunities to move around and lots of opportunities to innovate. Cisco is moving fast to a flexible, highly mobile work environment. You can get your work done from any place, device or screen that has a connection to the internet.

Cons
Crazy amounts of sales forecasting and opportunity updates (3 TIMES PER WEEK FOR MOST SALES TEAMS!) If you are an account manager, you'll submit your forecast over the weekend, have some sort of large opportunity review at the beginning of the next and then do another forecast at the end of the week. This leads many managers to micro-manage their teams. Salary, as part of overall compensation package is below average. When you overachieve, you do well. If you have a bad quarter or year, your checking account will suffer big time. Company bureaucracy sometimes slows things down.

Advice to Senior Management
Reduce the amount of internally focused behavior and forecasting so account teams can maximize the amount of time they have with their customers. Integrate the forecasting process and make it happen twice a week for the first 2 months of each quarter. Then move to weekly forecasts for the final month of a quarter or year.

From Cisco Systems Senior Program Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Sat, 3 Oct 2015

Pros
There are a lot of good things to say about working at Cisco, e.g., the benefits are good, there are a lot of good people there, and they encourage their people to give back to their community.

Cons
Cisco terminates thousands of employees every year through "restructuring" events. Rather than retraining and retaining talented employees they often replace them with younger, lower paid new hires. I guess that's the new normal in high tech.

Advice to Senior Management
Rather than terminating good, loyal employees, give them time to find another position within the company, even if means asking them to step down in pay grade.

Pros
Good work life Balance. CISCO brand value. Additional benefits are good.

Cons
Some projects are still on old technologies, nothing much to learn. less pay as compared to other product based companies. Managers are diplomatic and they demand buttering from employees if one needs some career growth.

Pros
J'ai passé de grandes années chez Cisco . Bon salaire, grande flexibilité. Les salariés qui sortent de Cisco sont en général de gros travailleurs, ouverts à l'international, agiles, dynamiques.

Cons
L'ambiance à Paris n'a rien a voir avec d'autres bureaux étrangers. Après trois plans de réduction des effectifs successifs les salariés français sont démotivés, exténués ou au bord du burn-out, notamment pour les fonctions supports presque toutes délocalisées en Pologne. Tous les salariés sont touchés par ces délocalisation (erreurs dans les paies, suivi des salariés...)

Advice to Senior Management
Voyez plus loin que la simple réduction rapide des coûts. La qualité doit rester au coeur des métiers.

Pros
Cisco has been a fantastic place to get work. Appreciated for innovative ideas and you are giving importance to your role. They treat you as experts in your area which is a big plus point :)

Cons
Sr. Managers/Directors have their own pets in the team. Some people don't deserve to be a Sr. Managers give stress to their team members who work under them. Some team members are allowed to go for training, certification but others are just told a BIG NO or NO budget. WFH is just say an option anymore and team members are forced to come to work or else told that they would loose their space or get into the bad list. Some Managers do micro management. What time we come to work , what time we leave and influence JR. people do report to them regarding this. No growth, everything is stable...no increment, no bonus...

Advice to Senior Management
Please remove these kind of micro managers from Cisco because they are not creating a healthy environment but stress. Every employee deserve to WFH as long as they are delivering and getting their work done. If we are talking about collaborative environment then why are we not giving space to sit with the team.

Pros
* Great Technology. * Training opportunities. * Most groups allow flexibility with Working from Home one or two days a week. * Annual Bonus based on company & individual performance.

Cons
* Layoffs (Restructuring) occurs on an annual basis. These restructuring are usually not just for individuals, might be a entire group with the decision made from management so your individual performance is not taken into account. Not a good environment to feel secure in your job. * Large company red tap and politics. * If you do not working at the mother ship location(San Jose) then you're considered a second class citizen.

Great benefits, global team, open to improvement, flexibility, work-life balance, connectivity, win, win, win mindset, customer focus, a vision of making the world a better place - all these things and more contributed to a sense of real pride in being a Cisco employee, regardless of the stock price.

Cons
Departure from employee ownership mindset was a terrible loss and reduced management credibility. Being the apparent source of many Dilbert strips regarding the over-reliance on meetings for every decision led to a great reduction in ability to delivery solutions in a timely, cogent manner.

Advice to Senior Management
Restore employee ownership mindset, reduce decision by committee via perpetual meeting.

From Cisco Systems Program Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Wed, 30 Sep 2015

Pros
Work from home, interesting technology, great customers.

Cons
Cisco is highly political. There are constant layoffs on a yearly basis. Often times contract workers are much more responsive and harder working than permanent staff, but contract workers go unrecognized and permanent employees receive preferred treatment over contract workers. The balance is not equal. Its also very difficult to get converted from contract to permanent employee.

Advice to Senior Management
Reward contract employees by their majority of their customer sat scores and based on what the majority of their colleagues actual experience is, rather than a 1created political story a few bullies create. This represents very poor company values and corporate culture.

From Cisco Systems Software Engineering I (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 30 Sep 2015

Pros
Flexible, good pay, good benefits. If you are looking to sleep through life then this is a comfortable company.

Cons
No motivation to innovate. Projects were dumped on my team 80% finished and tasked to make it "just work". Not a lot of design of the project itself so many things were less than optimized as well.

Advice to Senior Management
Let your employees innovate new products and steer the direction of development, instead of buying companies and spending years trying to figure out how they make sense as part of yours.

From Cisco Systems Senior Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 30 Sep 2015

Pros
Great place to learn about new technology. People are OK.

Cons
Very top heavy. People above senior director level make more money relative to the hours they put. But for manage level who really do the grunt work, no pay off. Progression is based on how long you have been with the company than your merit. Very political because of the leadership. Good people leave the place leaving it to the mediocre ones rise to the tiop as time goes by.

Advice to Senior Management
Improve the talent retention and promotion culture

Pros

Cons
Very little direction, just figure it out. Contracting is tough. You work for the company, but you don't. I think it would be better to be an actual Cisco employee, they seem to be quite happy with benefits, etc.

Advice to Senior Management
Help your employees and be more clear so they understand what you need them to do.

Pros
It's a good place to work for you if you are a beginner. Colleagues are friendly and open to ideas. Lots of opportunities to learn.

Cons
There is no salary increase. The management never cares about the salary increase of the existing employees though they are outstanding. Old style management. Needs to be completely revamped.

Advice to Senior Management
Old style management style. Needs to step up and let go of a few controls. Trust the engineers rather then having an iron grip on to things.

Pros
Flexible work environment (though varies significantly with the manager), good benefits. Easy to do minimal work and stay employed for many years.

Cons
Little chance for advancement, many vicious self-promoting middle management who lead with fear. HR is useless of course, and upper mgmt is too stupid to see what's going on. Last many years have gone way over board hiring undergrads who many of which have contributed nothing after 2-3 years. I know a few who are great, but most get by on being cute and perky, while the long term employees are forced to cover. Annual layoffs mostly hit those who do the most work, while middle management stays fat. Reorgs are done on a regular basis just because. If the current structure was so great last year why have yet another reorg? I've been moved 10 times between teams often even my own manager didn't know about it. No one asks if you want to move to that team, or if your skills are what is needed. We're just numbers.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't bother spewing the "we are family" BS, we see right through you. That motto died many years ago. Fix the layers and layers of processes to get even the simplest marketing campaign out the door. The Brand police are devoid of any creativity or innovation. Trust was broken many years ago.

Pros
Glad to work from home. I get more done and am more relaxed.

Cons
There is no logic to who gets promoted. Often, it's the least qualified. The good old boys network is clearly at work at Cisco. Very few women are even considered for promotions. There are lots of minority and women groups but I don't see that it's helping.They are all talk and no results.

Advice to Senior Management
Get to know your employees. Know who is contributing. Don't just look at their smooching ability and whether or not, you can relate to them. Consider their results and contribution..

Pros
Pay is on par with large companies. Office location is convenient. Benefits options allow flexibility on what to choose, but overall, you have to pay for everything, gym, childcare, onsite health care, etc.

Cons
Very conservative, old school way to run a company. Very political backstabbing environment. Limited growth potential. Benefits sound good, but in reality are not all that great...rather disappointing in fact. The entirety of free food offered is Coffee, Tea, filtered tap water, and popcorn. Overall, I'm sorry I chose to come to Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
When your whole org repeatedly tells you that there are morale problems, listen to them and do something about it. Treat your employees with respect, and make it a priority that all employees do so. Look at what your competition is offering, and understand why you're unable to hire talent you are looking for. Figure out why people don't want to work for Cisco, and change it. It's not that hard.

Pros
Remote working options, changing organizations internally, pay, a known brand worldwide- good for resume

Cons
Changing culture- there used to be a Cisco family, now became a layoff culture. Weak innovation culture, weak leadership and unclear company vision. Employee quality went down dramatically as managers don't want to hire competitive employeees for their own job security

Advice to Senior Management
Innovation instead of acquisition, and hire best people, go to stanford university instead of Santa Clara university.

Pros
the place sucks, nothing but empty words and they work you without any consideration. If you have a good boss it can be ok but if you have a crappy boss...good luck

Cons
if they are worried about meeting their wall st numbers be prepared to be furloughed without much notice. During the X-mas break be prepared to be furloughed for a longer period than the full time employees. They talk about how integral contractors are to the success of the company but it is simply empty words. They don't put their money where their mouth is. I would love to see how this place would collapse if all the contractors went out on strike for an extended period.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2011) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 25 Sep 2015

Pros
My director was an inspirational leader, someone who strongly advocated for his team. Our team was a family, a wonderful - too rare - collaborative family. Strong compensation including great benefits and campus perks.

Cons
I never knew which way the sand would shift underneath me. The company's senior leadership would point the "ship" in one direction and just when I was getting good progress toward the goal...they would change course significantly and I had just lost 6-9 months of work (60+ hour weeks, etc.)

Advice to Senior Management
Make sure you are prepared to follow through on a strategy before you "sell" it to the masses that it will be a critical key to the company's success....only to dismantle it midway into implementation.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Fri, 25 Sep 2015

Pros
good pay, flex working, good name for your CV if you want to move on and up!

Cons
dreadful culture - passive aggressive no one can talk straight, so it take years to get anything done. Execs so full of their own importance that they are complete barriers to getting anything done - massive entourages. Middle management is terrible often put there by an exec - many of them quite incompetent

Advice to Senior Management
remove underperfoming managers - you do enough surveys to know who they are. Stop execs politicising and preventing change, the company is quite archaic and can't move fast.

Cons

Pros
friendly environment between management and employees flexible work option. nice perks

Cons
Recruitment is very strange. Don't give importance to CCIEs, which is its own certification. Funny thing is people with less experience and less technical knowledge are hired and paid hefty pacages, i remember one of my collegue who doesn't know simple techinical stuff like OSPF were given offers of 26+ lacs..whereas talented techies are not even given a chance to attend a interview..No wonder why cisco is not performing well recently

Advice to Senior Management
Don't have the mindset of govt. offices..give chance to talent...Don't judge techies by their mouth..Real techies won't brag about much & only half baked techies willl advertise themselves..people with big mouth are given reward..

Pros
Flexible hours. You are free to work whatever 70 to 80 hours you prefer each week. The yearly layoff packages are fairly generous. When you finally get laid off (and that is how most people who leave the company do so, you have a good chance to double dip for awhile) You learn alot about corporate politics. You learn how to keep your Director happy and what happens when you get a Director that doesn't like you. You get to say you worked at Cisco and it looks good on a resume.

Cons
Yearly layoffs. NO ONE is ever safe. No one. I have seen top tier, highest rated engineers be cut. I have seen low performers cut. The cuts rarely have anything to do with performance, but are based primarily on how much your Director likes you (or knows you) Cisco has fairly low voluntarily attrition, but very high layoff attrition (the PC term is "limited restructure". Management fails to realize that every LR is a failure of management.

Advice to Senior Management
You are destroying the Cisco culture, by continuing to bring in people from the outside who do not value it, and in some cases resent the Cisco culture.

Pros
Exciting company that's been doing great things since the internet was born!

Getting a little to large to effectively manage at the same innovative level it's known for, although executive management has been doing an excellent job keeping up the pace in spite of that.

From Cisco Systems Network Consulting Engineer (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Tue, 22 Sep 2015

Pros
-The floor is air conditioned. -There's free coffee in the break room. -It gives you the opportunity to move to better departments within Cisco that treat there employees very well.

Cons
-They don't pay for their own certifications anymore, with the exception of the CCIE certifications. -Despite not paying for certifications the GDC still requires that you earn those certifications. -Don't ever expect to get raises or promotions. Cisco just had the best quarter they've had in years and no RTP GDC employees received raises due to budget constraints. -Despite the lack of raises and promotions your manager will expect that you perform like the salary grade above you is supposed to perform. -If you work hard you will be placed in a "queue," which is the GDC's way of retaining experienced employees for as long as they possibly can while they train new hires to replace them.

From Cisco Systems Technical Leader (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 21 Sep 2015

Pros
Great place to work with some great benefits. Work life balance is good. Company being large provides ample opportunities to switch in case one is not happy. Stock has languished for a while but that is had to understand.

Cons
Process overhead sometime is quite a bit. Also very conservative in terms of technology stack that it uses. Overall planning leaves less time for development and bunch of work is completed during actual QA cycles. Need to go agile with smaller release cycles.

Advice to Senior Management
Need to focus and believe that company can make , sell and generate profit from software based product. Many ventures has started and not completed as company does not think it can make money by software alone.

Pros
Large company benefits... You have a good choices for benefits, stock options. Flexibility in schedule and some really great people that work there.

Cons
Cost cutting is the primary focus. Once your in growth is hard. Was high performer year after year with no growth opportunities. Completely changed orgs, same high performance no opportunities to grow. So much cost cutting culture isn't the same as it use to be. Was a great company...

Advice to Senior Management
Focus on the employees again, all the great people are leaving. You continue to let this happen you won't be able to keep the folks you want to.

From Cisco Systems Senior Business Operations Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 21 Sep 2015

Pros
- Management works hard to share their message & vision with employees - Everyone is behind giving back - Can be an exciting fun place to work if your working on the hot initiative or product

Cons
- Management challenged to keep growing value for shareholders in a mature company so the employees can be seen as expendable - In their words the business moves so fast that they aren't good at planning ahead with regards to Headcount and have no qualms cutting HC as a way to move funding to other parts of the company - Culture and ability to grow sales and income feel "desperate" thus easy to justify not making employees first priority

Advice to Senior Management
you can do better by finding ways to take care of your existing employees then cutting them and then hiring new ones every year

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 2 of 2 found this helpful — Mon, 21 Sep 2015

Pros
Only name is big plus some company perks thats it.

Cons
Every year huge layoffs which makes it very unstable while upper management able to continue and secure their jobs which is totally unjust. Useless restructuring all the time which is just moving same teams under one manager to another while keeping same management team which is not going to improve anything. employees buttering their managers got promotions and higher bonuses even if they are not doing anything throughout the year which is culture adopted due to higher presence of people from India where this is pretty common. outsourcing of jobs to India which is on rise as Cisco is cutting jobs from here and hiring folks heavily in Bangalore India which is not a healthy trend and it was tried and failed in some groups in past. Some groups do not even have any USA employee presence and they are totally located in India while dev team is located here which caused latency in progress but since Indian lobby is pretty strong in Cisco they are able to save their jobs easily and rule the company. Moreover folks are laid off from here while people from India are pouring in every day in numbers.

Advice to Senior Management
Please stop these layoffs due to heavy outsourcing of local jobs in India, all these never ending layoffs/reorgs making it more unstable and bad mark on Cisco's employee loyalty. Funny thing is every year management announces record earnings like this year and there are behind the scenes huge layoffs which makes no sense and looks like employee hard work is not appreciated.

Not very impressive levels of ethics, and also relatively low levels of emotional intelligence. Compared to HP, which is where I worked before. Also, there is a wider range of intelligence levels there - some people I come across I wonder how they work there.

Advice to Senior Management
It would be great if we could encourage employees to take mandatory training on emotional intelligence. Some of the teachings from Stephen Covey would be a great place to start.

Advice to Senior Management
Give contractors a route to grow. Give contractors career advice. Everyone(FTEs/Contractors) should have something in it for them. How about performance bonuses for contractors? How about reviewing your manager yearly? Lot's of potential but moves like an elephant.

Pros
-Co-workers are generally good people -Access to large internal wiki with vast amount of information on various technologies

Cons

Advice to Senior Management
-Pull head out of the sand and listen to the intelligent people you hire that actually care about giving customers a better experience and making processes more efficient -Cultivate a culture within the company that is more about a better work environment, new ideas, mobility within organization, and encourages taking on learning opportunities and attaining certifications -Cultivate a management culture of customer service/customer experience above all else

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Company Proud"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 16 Sep 2015

Pros
I'm not one to be company proud - I'm more focused on my own area of expertise and doing it great for whomever I work for. However, Cisco is the first company where I'm like, "Wow! I WORK here? Seriously? Cool." It started with the little things, like seeing how the employees all came together around Girls in Tech day. Then, it was my team's global volunteer day. Then, it was watching our new CEO step into big shoes with grace and humility. Then it was seeing women in tech not treated really like "women. in. tech." but more like just people who do awesome things because they're awesome. Here are my pros: - Flexibility. Honest truth, I couldn't work at all without the flexible workplace option. I know everyone wants the cool office environment (as do I) but in my situation it wouldn't be possible. Thank you Cisco for being on the edge of that innovation. - The people. I have never gotten to work with such caring, smart, great people. Yes, there's a bad apple in every bunch, but this team comes together for each other like nothing I've seen before. - The work. Almost everyone I know talks about how their job changes the world. It's not a slogan, it's a reality. - For me personally, it's my manager. Orgs change all the time, but I hope she's always my lead. She says I'm the expert in what I do, so go do it. :)

Cons
Cisco is a big company, and thus has big company problems. They can be tackled, but turning a big ship takes a lot of effort. - There are silos. The left hand should really know what the right hand is doing. With an employee base of 75K, that's hard to do. But Cisco needs to get more in touch with its inner self. - Cisco likes process for process sake. I'm type-A, so I'm all for process. But filling out three forms to get one thing moving? They're working on this, I can tell. - Politics. This is a common problem with big companies. It's the part I hate the most. Stop marking your territory and just get things done.

Advice to Senior Management
- Create synergies (I hate that word) so people can work together, rather than on parallel paths. - Stop the process madness. - Foster an environment where politics aren't what gets things done, but people. - Keep focusing on employees and the People Deal - still aspirational, but a great direction.

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 16 Sep 2015

Pros
Great Colleagues and in all great office atmospheres around the offices I have visited.

Cons
As a large enterprise, things quickly drown in internal procedures, excessive meetings, mails and complex chain of commands, there are many smaller kingdoms inside Cisco, which can make it hard from time to time to assist and learn. People also focus on maintaining an inside career, which can make information sharing difficult.

Advice to Senior Management
More flat organisation for engineering..

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Sep 2015

Pros
At least I had some level of day-to-day freedom in my job, but that really depends on the department/management.

Cons
Wow, where do I begin? The company is headquartered in Japan and runs all it's international offices like they do in Japan, without taking into account that there are vast cultural and business differences at each country site. Due to this ethnocentric behavior, it was very difficult to get employees to buy into the "how' and "why" things were being done or not done a certain way. Senior management was essentially all from the Japan office, very bull-headed and two-faced. The US employees, including senior management, knew this, tried to appeal to HQ's better business sense, but more often than not failed to convince them to do things differently. There were really good people that left ACCESS, either willingly or RIF'd, but that's the cost of bad business decisions and poor communication.

Advice to Senior Management
I'd give advice if I thought they cared, but they don't. If anything, they resent being told they are doing anything wrong.

From Cisco Systems Human Resources Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Sep 2015

Pros
People are passionate about the strategy the new CEO has laid out, including the opportunity to transform the culture to make sure Cisco continues to be a leading technology company. They may not have all the answers on how they will do it, but they are willing to try different approaches and there is a very open, transparent approach being taken to how things will be done in the future to accomplish lofty goals and an inspiring vision.

Cons
Cisco is a large company and sometimes getting easy things done can be overly complex. They also need a better tool that enable teams to collaborate on editing files in real-time to save time managing through file changes when working across large groups.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep up the excellent work, stay on message and hold onto the open, transparent approach. They will help the company continue the transformation!

From Cisco Systems Director of Engineering (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Sep 2015

Pros
Reasonably good to work at if you have other responsibilities (like a family). Reasonably diverse (at least as compared to other SV companies), but still a long way to go, particularly with respect to women in senior management, Hispanics and African Americans.

Cons
Offshoring and shrinking like crazy at every opportunity. Terrible hiring practices ensures mediocre talent pool - stunningly poor in some cases. Substitutes "going through the motions" for "getting results" as primary goals - lots of meetings, emails, powerpoints, committees and so on. Hero worship at all levels of the org ensures groupthink prevails (which could be a positive if they had any heroes worth listening too, which they don't).

Advice to Senior Management
Replace the board. Stop holding your breath and hoping the competition will go away. Find some real growth and embrace it rather than digging your heels in like the competitors you once vanquished. This industry will eradicate you and in ten years nobody will remember your name otherwise.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Tue, 15 Sep 2015

Pros
Good work life balance. Co-workers are highly collaborative. Great opportunities to change roles every 18 to 24 months and work in another part of the company

Cons
No focus on career development. Managers can be out of touch. Not much focus on developing people and bench strength. Decisions take too long and company can be too slow to act.

Advice to Senior Management
Focus more on developing people and enabling employees to make faster decisions and enact them. Continue to improve life work balance. One of the best things they have.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Employee says "Great company, in touch with employees, competitive pay"

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 14 Sep 2015

Pros
- Excellent people to work with. Very fun and friendly atmosphere. There's pretty good "social" perks, like quarterly outings with the team, free donuts and bagels, and even beer on Thursdays. Management even listens to suggestions, and recently starting giving people their birthday off, company-wide! -There's some pretty neat projects to work on. It's always good working with relevant technologies and picking up skills that are valuable even on other projects and at other companies. I'd argue this is one of the most important aspects of a tech job. -Cisco is pretty good about recognizing achievements. If you do a really good job, Cisco will recognize you with some award, almost always accompanied by some cash and a goofy but appreciated certificate or plaque or trophy. -Pretty decent opportunities to move up and get raises. I've only been here a short while, but they do give modest annual raises, and I know people who get promotions every so often.

Cons
-A lot of the tooling is out of the stone age. It's extremely frustrating when you're trying to build the hot new thing, and you're constrained by tools and systems that have been obsolete for over a decade. In some areas we're using the hottest new things (docker, Jenkins, artifactory, VMware, etc.), and in other areas we're using systems from the 90s (CVS, SVN, a homemade bug tracking system, decade-plus old poorly written perl scripts, etc.) -Like any company this size, your experience will largely vary on who your manager is and what project you're on. I've personally had a great experience, but I know a few managers (definitely in the minority, but they do exist) who I would have a terrible time working for.

Advice to Senior Management
-You're doing great on the social aspects - keep up the good work there! -Work on the technical side. Be open to new technology, allocate money to move to it, and don't let stubborn old tech guys block progress when something better comes along.

Great company. A very good work life balance. A lot of genius workmates could help you grow up. The pay is competitive and people are quite nice.

Cons
Nothing special, I think this is one of the best places I have been working for. I think it is better if team assignment could based more on resumes.

Pros
good exposure into various clients. Flexible work hours, no one cares where you work from as long as you are doing your work to the satisfaction of your managers, field engineers and clients. compensation was good, and so were other benefits. Very employee friendly. certifications and continued learning.

Cons
Some of the teams in India were more back end. Even with client relationships, you would be doing work that the Field engineers were not interested in doing. It was cost effective for you to be doing the work. Not easy to shift teams. If you get stuck in some of the teams from which you wanted to shift, it would take a long time. There is no internal mechanism to rotate or provide opportunity for people to explore other roles within the company.

Advice to Senior Management
Provide opportunity to rotate employees. Create a platform where roles within the company are actively advertised and internal candidates can apply and shift roles.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Contractor says "Committed to Diversity"

From Cisco Systems Contractor (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sat, 12 Sep 2015

Pros
I liked the diversity of employees hired as contractors. Working conditions include flexible hours and lots of challenging opportunities.

Cons
If one is looking for permanent employment, contracting is not a stepping stone to that. Contractors do not get benefits so it can be uncomfortable to work very hard for permanent staff who have paid vacations; many contractors because they are not paid for holidays or mandatory vacation days make a lot less than their stated annual "salaries".

Advice to Senior Management
Keep up the diversity of employees, both permanent and temporary. Treat the janitorial folks well and don't neglect cleaning facilities frequently enough just to save some money.

Pros
Premium brand. Big money to invest in M&A

Cons
still a hardware company. Comp and profit is based on serial numbers moved, hdw maintenance and licenses for legacy VoIP and route/switch products.

Advice to Senior Management
Start at the top for annual OCT RIF, especially in Enterprise. The 15 to 20 years guys have churned and burned long enough and the weekly commit is very short sited and dysfunctional in a software (SDN) cloud solution industry.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Technical Leader I says "cisco india"

From Cisco Systems Technical Leader I (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sat, 12 Sep 2015

Pros
Culture of innovation, early adoption, several groups/technologies to pick, flexible management which is employee friendly most times, good reward system (works well most times but has some flaws as well)

Cons
Management relies heavily on managers feedback. There are instances when good employees suffer due to poor managers. And stress on innovation seems artificial many times leading to several employees pretending to be innovating by trying to file patents on someone else's ideas or simple ideas ..

Advice to Senior Management
Engineers must have more autonomy and managers hold on engineer should be reduced. Undue stress on innovation will not yield results. Create environments that are conducive for innovation and growth and leave the rest to people...

From Cisco Systems Software Engineer IV (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Fri, 11 Sep 2015

Pros
Cisco is the Industry leader, and you get exposed to all the technologies needed.

Cons
The company is too big and each team is more concerned about short term budget and goals, rather than planning for the long run. The idea of "getting fresh blood" and "restructuring" that pushed the experienced ones out (either voluntarily and involuntarily) is a big loss to Cisco's investment. While there is a need to adjust to ever-changing industry need, the negative spiral and the huge loss of intellectual assets, which were really invaluable and hard to replace. I personally had to witness a good number of colleagues go in last couple of years leaving. They were all smart and important to the team. Letting them go were really wrong decisions.

Advice to Senior Management
Employees are not commodities. Domain expertise can not be easily swapped out, especially in networking software. Management team need to work harder to treasure the real assets... the engineers.

Great people, solid well known brand and flexible working conditions. Cisco employees receive numerous benefits including but not limited to health insurance, gym membership, finance & decent salary + bonuses.

Less base pay, expensive corporate housing - so I decided to arrange for my own accommodation.

Advice to Senior Management
They should provide free/subsidized corporate housing because bay area is super expensive.

Culture varies wildly by BU. A number of BUs (like most companies) have lifetime riders in positions working on products they don't care about. Politics are typical.

Advice to Senior Management
Get rid of the politics between BUs. Minimize committee decisions. Reach out to ICs and learn what the problems are. Adjust.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Finance Intern says "Finance Internship"

From Cisco Systems Finance Intern (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 9 Sep 2015

Pros
-The people -Since Cisco is a big company, you get to meet a lot of different people. During the internship we were placed in groups and worked in various different functions for a group project, on top of our more concrete job roles in Finance. It was great being able to work with and get to know other areas of the company such as Marketing, HR, along with upper level management at Cisco. The internship was a great experience.

Cons
If you aren't from the area pray you have connections or can get connections to find housing in the Area. 3k signing bonus came out to $1600, a lot of people not from the area barely break even with the wage.$22 an hour in Silicon Valley is hard to get by on, that is, if you are coming from out of state and don't have your parents fund to tap into. -There wasn't that much diversity in terms of the schools represented.

Advice to Senior Management
-higher bonus could help get more people to try Cisco -More details on events for interns and make them mandatory -Keep up the good work!

From Cisco Systems Network Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 9 Sep 2015

Pros
I love working in the Technical Services organization at Cisco in RTP, NC. There is a competitive, yet laid-back atmosphere that I really enjoy. There are many opportunities for development and coworkers and managers are very supportive and are typically quick to recognize individuals for their good work. The salary is decent but coupled with all the great benefits the overall compensation package is certainly competitive.

Cons
Skilled engineers can make a better base salary at smaller companies in the area although job stability and the benefits are likely the trade-off. Otherwise I can't think of many cons to working at Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep inspiring engineers to perform their best and never stop recognizing the high performers on your team!

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior Software Engineer says "Average place for a Software Engineer"

From Cisco Systems Senior Software Engineer (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Tue, 8 Sep 2015

Pros
Once you understand that Cisco has a multitude of drastically different groups, then you can understand that all the reviews (positive and negative) are not contradictory. This is a pro in that you can find practically any work environment you would like. Modern, agile environments, chaotic start-up like, to stable, legacy ones. Unfortunately the great ones are a bit hard to find among the mediocre. Decent work like balance, with some telecommuting the norm.

Cons
Moral has taken a beating with 4 years of consecutive LR. Management is over-bloated, despite attempts to trim down. Upward progression and salary raises are difficult with the stack rank approach. Eventually compensation lags behind industry norms, forcing good people to look elsewhere. Difficult environment to innovate. Tools and software practices lag behind industry standard by years. Too much attachment to legacy. Too much re-invention of the wheel. The culture of frugality is a bit extreme. The quarter to quarter chasing of the shareholder expectations creates a poor environment for long term strategy. Too much chasing/trailing the competition.

Advice to Senior Management
Need a coherent software strategy that isn't based on chasing the latest Senior VP's need for a legacy. Too much middle management politics, favoritism and cronyism. Lots of talk about risk taking and innovation, little to show for in reality due to unwillingness to be held accountable.

Pros
Good benefits and flexible work hours. Office is located in Boulder Colorado. A lot of sharp co-workers. If you get your full bonus, compensation is decent.

Cons
Terrible local senior management. No possibility for growth. Facility keeps shrinking. Poor work/life balance - 24/7 pager duty. The site is always scrambling for work.

Advice to Senior Management
Senior management comes from Avaya and needs to learn a different style of management. Reviews are very subjective instead of objective. Also reviews are used as punishment instead of constructive feedback.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2011) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Mon, 7 Sep 2015

Pros
Flexible work hours, good work from home policies. Facilities are good, great gym and cafeteria facilities. Good work life balance, rarely work on weekends except during project go lives.

Cons
Politics and outsourcing. Cisco is an outsourcing hub and has a very skewed employee to consultant ratio in some departments. (IT etc.). Expect lots of finger pointing, non accountability and immense politics. Organization goals change every year, annual lay offs. Too many old timers and entrenched silos, too much stake in retaining status quo. Speak up and be punished.

Advice to Senior Management
Organization has too many layers, corporate initiatives simply do not translate down meaningfully to the rank and file. Cut down on the outsourcing, it might be lowering costs but comes at the cost of reduced accountability, loss of expertise and lots of politics. It does not promote efficiencies.

Pros
There are a lot of smart people here. New CEO seems to be moving pretty quickly. Buildings have been updated and there are lounge areas, games on each floor. Pretty good employee discounts.

Cons
Still getting used to the open floorplan and pods with 4-6 people with no storage or set locations. I have ergonomic issues so have requested an "anchor' location. Hiring standards seem to be deteriorating as my new neighbor is kind of creepy and strange - frequently talks to himself and doesn't understand boundaries. Hope this is just an aberration.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep folks informed of what's going on and provide greater transparency. Technology wise I think things are on track. Looking forward to seeing more of the Internet of Everything.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Thu, 3 Sep 2015

Pros
Work from home and flexibility in work hours are the biggest Pros why people want to stick to with the company.

Cons
Network Consulting Engineer job is a thankless job at cisco with no great pay compared to other job roles. No one values this job role as much as they do if you were in Sales. Software Development and/or Hardware Development. Very hard to grow up if you are sincere, hard working and self starter, probably you will end up working more and nothing else. Other big companies give benefits to their employees and so does cisco, so nothing different and great in it.

Advice to Senior Management
Please take care of your Network Consulting Engineers rather than just increasing work load with less or no increase in pay. There is lot more dissatisfaction.

From Cisco Systems Contractor/SME -- WW Sales Support (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 2 Sep 2015

Pros
Generally friendly and employees do not seem to have a cutthroat attitude. People do go out of their way to help you

Cons
In terms of documentation or training or expertise, nobody knows what anybody else is doing. There may be three or four groups trying to accomplish nearly the same goals in providing training labs or POC environments, and none of the groups even know that any other exists. TOI and documentation are miserable.

Advice to Senior Management
Documentation is so bad, I truly believe it is an intentional strategy to sell classes and certifications. Inexcusable bad documentation and TOI

From Cisco Systems Customer Support Engineer III (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 2 Sep 2015

Pros
Cisco TAC is a nice place to polish the technical skills, learn troubleshooting methodology, and get various kind of customer service experiences.

Cons
Many engineers after working for a certain period, start to rely on routine responses and loses the excitement on problem solving, which as a result would harm the career. So the advice is, if you want to keep working in TAC for a long time, make sure to rotate to other team or products periodically and leave the comfort zone before it became too late.

Pros
Large corporation allows a lot of networking and options to move between teams. The environment is very flexible and most work remotely.

Cons
Frequent disconnects between teams and overlaps between roles. Once you start as a contractor, it is unlikely that the position will convert to permanent employee.

Pros
Good work environment; flexible work hours; great work-life balance.

Cons
Sometimes left hand doesn't talk to right hand. They need a bit more transparency at the managerial level especially when it comes to handling the layoffs. One week you are interviewing odes of people and the next you are laying off the very people. Makes people really insecure about their careers.

Advice to Senior Management
Transparency at all levels, clear communication.

Pros
People. Easiest way to explain it is, at Cisco people Care. They care about the customer, they care about doing the right thing, they care about the companies vision and direction. I have sent mails to VP's and even the President of the company and have always been treated with respect and deference. That is very telling on what a true open door policy looks like. I think the greatest support for Cisco statistically is that people who work here don't leave. I'm in a high level consulting position and get constant job offers, but no other companies create as compelling and challenging of a work environment as Cisco has to offer. Absolute great company to work for, and has my highest recommendation from a 15 year industry vet who has worked for top companies around the world including Microsoft.

Cons
Typical Company cons that can all be summed up by "slow moving". But nothing that effects my job. If I ever have a blocking issue I tell management and they take care of it.

Advice to Senior Management
I see you putting a lot of focus on career development. I see you taking organizational health survey's seriously. Keep that up, it helps employees understand and feel the appreciation you have for their work. - The division of sales and services in field engagement is Cisco's number one customer satisfaction problem. - Server and Network support contracts should be converged instead of separated. Disjointed contracts create one level of Network Service and a different level (almost always less or below standard) for server services. - Clear cloud leadership and vision should be defined for all major sectors (Microsoft / Amazon / Openstack)

Pros
Good Pay, Mostly smart workforce, good technology

Success is managed to the point that you can't do great, but won't do bad either. Big company BS. Sausage is ugly to watch being made

Pros
Very nice employee policies, facilities are at the top of the world. Food, canteens. Work culture, work from anywhere policy is the best in world.

Cons
If your a smart/hard worker, its easy to get laid off. You are just a number and who should involve in team politics. Team lead should be your role model & manager should be always right;else you are useless for the team. Change in processes near impossible, even if it makes total sense, typical of large corporations.

Advice to Senior Management
Employee should be free to contact any peer manager and there should be a review meeting with two senior managers of his/her manager, before a employee leaves the project or company.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 26 Aug 2015

Pros
- The best place to dive deep into and get your hands dirty working on technology, for those who like it. - Employees are mostly well looked after, though there have been gradual cost cuttings in the last 5 years. - Management is very chaotic but the employees are very professional and maintain a good environment. - Work life balance can be awesome or horrible based on your manager.

Cons
- Management level changes are so frequent that it instils a lack of confidence in your career in the org. - Politics is everywhere. Sometimes very evident, sometimes subtle. - Vision is very high level and implementation is very chaotic. Low level employees rarely have a say in any decision. - Work life balance can be awesome or horrible based on your manager.

Advice to Senior Management
One very fixed poll for management feedback is not enough. Management needs to take an open ended anonymous feedback from the employees at every level to really have an insight into what is right and what is not.

From Cisco Systems Senior Finance Controller (Past Employee - 2013) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 26 Aug 2015

Pros
Seemingly unlimited resources to get work done. Cisco's motto has been - throw bodies at the problem and we'll work it out.

Cons
The systems are very lacking because they continually throw cheap labor at the problem versus being more efficient and solving the problem with systems.

Advice to Senior Management
Stay with your strategy for more than one year. Plans seem to change every six months and the average employee gets confused by all the different and sometimes conflicting priorities.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Wed, 26 Aug 2015

Pros
There were plenty of resources to utilize to accomplish the tasks given. The people that work there are friendly, team oriented, and collaborative.

Cons
They tend to bring on contractors with the idea of potential full time employment. This is a rarity. I have seen contractors there that have had a contract for over 5 years. Not very forth coming with information at times.

Advice to Senior Management
The management needs to be more forth coming with information, intentions, and expectations. They need to be a little more engaging and aware of what has transpired.

Pros
Good environment, the colleges are all very nice and professional. The company is very big so you can get helps from a lot of peoples. And also many resources to look into

Cons
The company is quite large , so it takes many admin staff when you are about to do or work. That slows down the process and drag you down.

Advice to Senior Management
More flexiable working flow would definetly increase the profit and the employee's willing to work better and accerlarate the circle.

Pros
the brand name - know that you are employed with one of the well known IT Giants

Cons
No respect for employees - especially when they want to cut resources - hard work, sincerity have no role to play - biggest worry : no job security.... you can get the marching orders anytime without rhyme or reason ! Highly political !

Advice to Senior Management
Cut the crap of using the tag line " Deinvest to Reinvest !!" People have given the company their hard work and sweat to get you where you are - respect people who put in 10 yrs + and be a company that respects the truth when said on the face - much of the political drama is not needed !

From Cisco Systems Product Manager (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Tue, 25 Aug 2015

Pros
Good opportunities to do impactful work for Cisco's customers, plus great co-workers make the day-to-day work enjoyable and successful. Just an aside: Cisco's quality cafeterias serve delicious breakfasts and lunches to fuel all the extra PowerPoint slides you'll have to complete.

Cons
Management needs everything translated into PowerPoint to understand SW development status; unfortunately, they don't understand typical Agile, bug or analytics reports. It will seem like you have to do twice as much work to complete a task: once to complete the actual work product, then a second time to redo things in PowerPoint for your manager.

Advice to Senior Management
Learn some modern Agile/Scrum management skills so that your employees can be more a lot productive.

Pros
Picking the right group to work for is what it matters at Cisco. Corporate affair- education part of the Cisco is where I recommend.

Cons
Haven't really noticed one rather than minor things like not enough cafeterias or good quality of food in current cafe. They culd add free drink back and offer some snacks.

Pros
Besides being a well known company I didn't see many Pros about working there. If you were lucky enough to be part of a company Cisco acquired then you were compensated well but you would also lose your culture and identity.

Cons
Their consistent layoffs were always a major downer amongst the team. You never knew if this was the year your position would be cut or if they would move it to the North Carolina in order 'save money'.

Advice to Senior Management
Listen to the grunts working in the trenches when they ask for improvements and give feedback on their superiors so they can be semi-happy.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Systems Engineer says "An amazing company with plenty of growth opportunities"

From Cisco Systems Systems Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Tue, 25 Aug 2015

Pros
I have been with Cisco for 3 years and I believe overall that this is an outstanding company to work for. This is the first company I have worked for that actually recognizes, values and *compensates* you for hard work. And if you prove to management your value and contributions to the overall company, they will absolutely take care of you when it comes to things such as relocation, education, and schedule flexibility. Since collaboration technologies are a huge part of the business model, there are a lot of remote work options (i.e. work from home, road, etc.) - but this depends on your exact role in the company.

Cons
The dreaded "work/life" balance is probably the number one complaint across Cisco employees but it is what you make of it. I know plenty of people that work at Cisco and maintain a pretty close 8-5 work schedule and are highly productive; I know others that work seemingly all hours of the day and night. It's up to you, setting the level of expectation and how efficient you are. But it is extremely easy to get very wrapped up with work and leave little time for anything else.

Advice to Senior Management
Cisco has weathered the storm of numerous disruptors and market transitions over the past 30 years. To remain successful, which I have no doubt they will, they will need to continue to be aggressive on acquiring key talent, intellectual property, and not catch trends from behind (i.e. universal compute, SDN).

1. Good management employee relationship. 2. Lenient Work Culture. 3. Great campus and the facilities. 4. If you want to spend your life peacefully without any tension and work pressure, you should join Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Let employee work on what they like. There are pools of opportunities inside Cisco, let employee choose what he/she want to work on. Employee should not be given work on random basis.

Cons
The level of all the interns was not the same. There should have been a higher level of knowledge expected from a few of the other interns that were there.

Advice to Senior Management
A higher standard of the students that apply would solve the only con I had with this Internship.

From Cisco Systems Tech Lead (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 24 Aug 2015

Pros
Big Name adds to resume. Big Lab adds to motivation initially. Big infrastructure. Flexible environment

Cons
Webex - every one (locals) wants to work/connect on webex only If teams members are sitting away you are never sure if someone is working from where. It looks good but it is not. It affects your performance too. You will always be seeking appointment. Cisco is confused elephant now. Unsure what it wants to do. Networking or Small Cell or Cloud or Data Center or Smart City or IoT. Many other company failed in past and re-focused on what they do best. Wants to become #1 IT company but using only networking product, yet doing all stuff. For it employee are mere commodities. Does not have any emotional attitudes towards them. It is flexible bcos most team at world wide so you will be on call most of time and rest in lab. Indians engineers spoil their personal life and become 24*7 slave if they can not handle it smartly. Infra looks good but once in team you will realize how hard to get good cubicles is big task. All are fitting for it, so you will end up sitting somewhere.

Advice to Senior Management
Do Business by heart. Dont run to be number 1, just do good work. Share company success with employee and just do not fire them like annual festival, instead adjust salaries. No point acquiring companies at extra price every week and firing own employees regularly.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 24 Aug 2015

Pros
Unbelievable experience. I had the privilege of interning for two different companies prior to this internship. The Worldwide Sales Internship blows the other two out of the water. The training and structure of the program is impressive. You are able to communicate and work alongside actual account managers, and really make contributions to account teams. You are able to see and meet C-level executives, and be in an environment where people are always looking to help others. The managers are awesome. I'm a firm believer that this is one of the top internships offered in all of business.

Cons
Cannot think of a con.

Pros
Flexible work-from-home policy. Reasonably good benefits.

Cons
Cisco is an engineering company run by Sales people. Always has and probably always will be. This shows in the way they are always chasing the cash flow instead of thinking about what lies ahead in the world of networking. This is why the missed the whole Cloud computing market and when they finally found it, they fell back on their old game of trying to lock-in the customer with a proprietary (no matter what they may say) solution. The world isn't buying that any more. Not to worry, they can just layoff staff and buy more with a technology that's currently hot.

Advice to Senior Management
Find a way to quietly retire and let your employees breath.

From Cisco Systems Senior Technical Writer (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Sun, 23 Aug 2015

Pros
It's fairly easy to have a long, rewarding career at Cisco. Just do good work and keep your head down, and they'll take care of you.

Cons
Annual layoffs. Management regularly balances the books by reducing headcount. If you're a strong performer in engineering, you're probably safe. But no one is untouchable if your entire business unit gets shut down.

Pros
Good pay and ok benefits. The company was great at the beginning when I first joined over 16 years ago. Good moral and coworkers.

Cons
But Later it started outsourcing jobs to other countries and hired a whole bunch of people from India to take over the company operations. Then the company went down hill and never really recovered. It has been laying people off pretty much every year and let thousands go.

Advice to Senior Management
Get some real good people with management skills, not just people from India.

Pros
Great team environment, open to provide support and collaboration when needed. Projects that have to span teams are able to be completed because each group is held accountable for pulling their own weight.

Cons
Lack of transparency from peer reviews regarding promotions. Feeling the immediate impact of your day to day work in a company this size is not easily noted. Difficult to implement change. Process heavy day to day work.

Advice to Senior Management
Streamline the promotions process. Find a way to make end to end reporting play a role in strategy. So much energy is focused on execution - with no results based feedback taken into account on future work that needs to be done.

They don't Convert Contractors to Fulltimers inspite working with them for close to 7 years.

Pros
name is big that is only pros in this company

Cons
Highly unstable company with frequent re-orgs and layoffs multiple times every year. This year Cisco is celebrating record sales but there is huge layoff going on right now with employees who put their heart and soul to make this huge profit this year are rewarded with layoff package which is very sad. Management has no clear guidelines and they are busy all the time in laying off people from US HQ and hiring more and more people in India. Work culture is also very poor. Full of politics and only those close to upper management are rewarded with promotions.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 19 Aug 2015

Pros
Great employees, talented and motivated to work. Great work environment and depending one department possible to work remotely. Great technology and sometime leaning opportunities (i.e. if your schedule permits)

Cons
Unstable work environment due to constant restructuring and lay offs some of which are done without consideration for the valued talent. Individual performance is not considered when your unit falls on the chopping block. It is like cut off the the arm, and the finger is not saved. Lot of internal politic.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep your talents. Do more home work before you lay off middle managers and the reporting structure. When you lay off, remember to leave some employee to mentor the new one- for better knowledge transfer.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Wed, 19 Aug 2015

Pros
Flexibility in schedule, company culture of inclusiveness, transparency, and willingness to help one's peers are all reasons I enjoy working for this company. I have had many managers, and each one has created a positive team environment over the years... this is driven from the top down.

Cons
Like any company of its size, it can take a long time and involve a large number of people, to steer the ship. I would love for Cisco to bring to market solutions more quickly than they sometimes do.

Advice to Senior Management
Keep up the good work. Encourage transparency among your employees and support them when they are looking for other opportunity inside the company. There are a lot of jobs to go around inside Cisco, and supporting these transitions will encourage the best back fills to come your way.

Pros
Company has a lot of opportunities for growth and allows a lot of flexibility in terms of hours you work and environment you work in. Many people tend to work from home including myself

Cons
Company culture has shifted. Where it was good to collaborate with other teams an drive cross organization efficiency it has become very political. Many of teams are trying to build empires or hold other teams responsible to pay for things. Company doesn't value experience as much as it used too.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Wed, 19 Aug 2015

Pros
Smart people who really want to work together Great networking technology Strong industry and brad recognition Broadest networking portfolio in the industry World class supply chain Good pay and benefits

Cons
Most executives aren't prepared to lead (Think IBM in the 90s) Market is moving to a software model and Cisco is not prepared Major customers want alternate suppliers due to Cisco's historic pricing Slow to deliver customer specific features Too may silos. Like any large company, lots of political fiefdoms.. if you're in a good group, great company. If you're not it's pretty unpleasant.

Advice to Senior Management
Package half the VPs who are just vesting in place and who offer no vision other than political positioning Create a clear vision that is more that marketing (IoE and cloud is not a plan) Incent and inspire workers to stay... there's a massive talent exodus

From Cisco Systems Executive Assistant (Past Employee - 2014) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Wed, 19 Aug 2015

Pros
Work/life balance, the people, and the ability to work remote. The key is to find the right team or group for you, the nice thing is there is always opportunities to move around.

Cons
Some of the procedures were outdated and stale. Their pay structure is definitely on the lower end for this area. They need more "perks" if they want to compete with other large companies in the area.

From Cisco Systems Technical Leader (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Wed, 19 Aug 2015

Pros
Flexibility - people can work remote somewhat, depending on your manager. However, if people don't see you in the office, people may not know who you are. When the next localized or global layoff (which is very frequent) comes, you may have the high chance to be on the list.

Cons
There are groups at Cisco which are plainly fat. There primary existences are to justify their own existences by spinning initiatives to make them look good even though there are no meets in those initiatives.

Advice to Senior Management
Changes are good. Majority of the top folks have been run the same folks for the past decades - layer 1 is done. The CEO needs to do the same on the 2 - 3 layers down.

Pros
Cisco is one of the biggest IT companies with vast technology offerings. If you enjoy learning new things everyday then this is a great place to work on. Sales incentives (on top of an attractive commission acceleration mechanism) are good.

Cons
Business is too complex. Tends to get too political.

Advice to Senior Management
Appreciate key performers. Discipline bad employees.

Pros
Aggressive in compensation, mainly in terms of commissions. Best company in Telecommunications and IT that provide a tremendous relationship with their partners.

Cons
There is a weak HR department. Weak in an internal process in job rotation. Big Layoff unnecessary even if the FY was good and the next one looks like in a line of growing.

Pros
You can get by with little effort and collect a paycheck.

Inspire the workers to have a reason to perform

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Marketing Manager says "Beware of Team Culture and Management"

From Cisco Systems Marketing Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 1.0 out of 5 — 3 of 3 found this helpful — Tue, 18 Aug 2015

Pros
Stayed at the company because telecommuting is a great perk. But at some point, you wonder if that is enough to offset the kind of poor management and unhealthy team dynamic. Note this is dependent on the team you're on. Company culture as a whole is not bad.

Cons
Lots of strong individual contributors get promoted but I've seen too many of those promoted to people managers who make terrible bosses. The worst part is they were able to get promoted because of political savvy so even the type of bullying, micromanagement, and all sorts of management nightmares go undetected by most with their subtle harassment.

Advice to Senior Management
Get rid of the middle management. Actually make people managers accountable for their actions based on their reports' feedback.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Product Engineer says "Good pay, bad innovation"

From Cisco Systems Product Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — 1 of 1 found this helpful — Tue, 18 Aug 2015

Pros
Competitive pay and benefits. Getting to work on products that build the worlds network infrastructure. There are tons of training classes that you can take at no cost.

Cons
Cisco has become so large that it can't effectively innovate anymore. It seems like all the new and best tech coming from Cisco is a product of recent acquisitions.

Advice to Senior Management
Stop running the company with a spreadsheet and put the engineers back in charge. Without a focus on substantial innovation and talent retention the days of Cisco leading the telecom market could come to an end.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 2.0 out of 5 — Tue, 18 Aug 2015

Pros
Best parts of Cisco is they are nearly every where. You can transfer to different parts of the world where Cisco is.

Cons
In HQs we lack diversity. Too many H1s who are robot workers. Minimal creativity or innovation. Hard workers, but can't prioritize. The more senior folks don't work full-time anymore. Do they feel entitled?

Advice to Senior Management
I don't have advice to a company the size of Cisco. It would be good to continue to increasing your footprint world wide for more opportunities.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Senior Director says "Great legacy, still good people, need to broaden and modernize"

From Cisco Systems Senior Director (Past Employee - 2011) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 17 Aug 2015

Pros
Incredible engineering depth in many areas -- obviously more true in networking related products, but there are very strong people in many parts of the company. The engineering / product side (CDO) is a kind place - they legitimately try to do the right things the right way. Most senior management (SVP and above) is very competent.

Cons
Promotion and growth opportunities for the rank and file are too few, with forced stack-ranking creating dis-incentives to the largest proportion of engineers (who are not deemed top 10%). Constant spin-in process for new and next-generation platforms from a very small cadre of (admittedly very talented) folks leads to morale issues in teams left to focus on legacy platforms.

Advice to Senior Management
Broaden the offerings within the data center to include full range of infrastructure (networking and compute need storage too.. both scale-up block and file as well as scale-out). Focus on adding software for scaled deployments -- archaic CLI and SNMP must go across the board. Data Center/Cloud infrastructure platforms should be combined with full-stack IAAS and PAAS for both on-premises and SP offerings.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 17 Aug 2015

Pros
Your experience will vary significantly based on which department you work in. For most supply chain management roles, the work & life balance is exceptional and hard to give up.

Cons
The downside is that although the company's goal is to be the number one IT company in the world, there is little to none creativity encouraged, your coworkers will have been in their same role for 15+ years, and your day to day activities will not be challenging/ exciting/ motivating. I found it hard to stay fulfilled at Cisco. But depending on what you are trying to get out of your career, this might as well be listed as a pro.

Advice to Senior Management
Don't discourage creativity, disruption. Clean up the promotions process, the fact that one can only move up the ladder based on seniority is unmotivating. Talent, hard work, and risk should be rewarded not discouraged to excel. And moving up should not solely be a product of how many years you have been there.

From Cisco Systems Employee (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 17 Aug 2015

Pros
Flexible employer, easy to work from home, six weeks vacation for Norwegian employees. Also, in many ways remarkably open in sharing information publicly for a company in this industry, which is sympathetic.

Cons
Yearly layoffs euphemized as "limited restructuring" for many years in a row, with little and mostly useless information to the organization both leading up to and after the layoffs. Lack of clear direction for many functions and products, leading to uncertainty and frustrations. In many cases horrible coordination across sites, teams, and time zones on larger projects and programs, which the org seems to struggle to admit to, pretending cross-site collaboration is a cinch.

From Cisco Systems Software Technical Lead (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Mon, 17 Aug 2015

Pros
When I started at Cisco the corporate culture was all based on the premise of independent, small groups working furiously to move the company forward. I recall Chambers referring to this culture with a statement that went something along the lines of "Cisco is the largest startup around". There certainly were drawbacks to such an approach - mostly around the costs - but on balance this system worked. Cisco was a great and dynamic place to work, filled with folks who were enthusiastic about their work, excited about the future, and ready to sacrifice for a place they felt cared about their welfare. This is no longer the case. Cisco has morphed over the years into a large corporate hierarchy filled with the same political intrigues and maneuvering that plague other companies of this size. Gone is the sense that the employee matters; gone is the willingness to sacrifice; gone is the sense that the company as a whole is united. But this doesn't necessarily make Cisco a bad place to work - it's just not particularly exciting or different from other large corporate behemoth's. Nowadays, people don't come to Cisco to find groups bubbling with excitement, they come to Cisco for the stability of a large, entrenched, and healthy company with a solid compensation system. If you're comfortable with a silo'd environment, where you keep your head down and do what's asked of you than Cisco may be a good fit.

Cons
This is a large company - with large company politics, management, and stifling red-tape overhead. It can be a stable place to work, but be careful to attach yourself to projects that are focused on the corporate development plan. Failure to follow this advice will place you square in the sights for their bi-annual layoff's.

Advice to Senior Management
Work to regain the spark - break huge development teams up into small hyper functional blocks, Incentivize the employee's again with financial benefits, restart annual pay raises.

Pros
Reputable company, doesn't hurt to have them on the resume. Cisco tries to do something for their employees. Of course it's easier for big profitable company. Good work/life balance, good benefits and corporate perks.

Cons
Too much politics and too many conflicting groups of interest. Many layers of management. Not all are capable. Regular layoffs to weed out the lower 5%, I guess. Mix between Cisco veterans and more recent additions. Veterans can be lacking sense of ownership and don't really own/drive or behave like they could make a difference. Maybe that happens if one stays too long at this company.

Advice to Senior Management
Adopt more humbleness and don't rest on old laurels. Willingness to reinvent the company and break down historic power channels.

From Cisco Systems IT Engineer (Past Employee - 2015) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 14 Aug 2015

Pros
Flexible hours. As long as you get your work done, nobody cares what you do or where you do it. Lots of corporate-wide events where you get free food and booze. People are friendly and there are enough younger folk to make it interesting. I'm fairly certain everyone there gets baked on a regular basis.

Cons
Weird mix of young and old. People there longer than two years tend to stagnate. Not a lot of upward mobility, but diagonal is always an option. Campus is giant, so a car is needed. Cisco overall doesn't really change. They're trying to get into this "Internet of Everything" but they don't really know how to do it. Expect a lot of self-congratulation from the senior management.

Advice to Senior Management
Pay people what they're worth. Average salary is 90% or lower than the industry average. Meet with your employees more often. I saw my manager once this summer.

Pros
(1) Flexible work environment. Can work from home (2) Salary and benefits are good (3) Still has a few good executives and leaders

Cons
(1) Cisco has been in a state of constant restructuring for the last 4 years. Roles and responsibilities can change overnight (2) Morale of employees is at an all time low. And most of the management does not seem to care (3) Cisco has lost its innovation edge. Its a company that is slowly going out of business (4) Zero career growth opportunities

Advice to Senior Management
Please recognize people for their skills and talent. Employees are paying the price for poor judgement and poor execution at the top.

Pros
Awesome company culture Great growth potential in both technical and management tracks Flexible work environment - remote or in-office rarely matters (depends on the job though) Great products and strong history Encouraged to jump within the company to constantly learn new skills Regardless of what your plans are, Cisco looks great on a resume

Cons
Location - RTP nowhere as exciting as San Jose for a new college grad, but great for families Heard mixed reviews about compensation being industry competitive HUGE company.. so it takes a while to get things done

Advice to Senior Management
Keep on innovating and leading Good luck Chuck!

Pros
Great co-workers, great place to learn, great environment, great benefits, overall lots of fun day to day. Lots of good outings as well.

Cons
terrible bureaucracy. and lack of pay and respect for their employees long term careers. So much transition that helps benefit them short term but is deceiving for long term benefits to the company

Advice to Senior Management
I know you are trying to change to a new direction but cycling through employees are a bad idea long term, good short term but you are going to kill productivity and products faster than you will start them. I am sad I had to leave before team got layoff after layoff to the point they got cut. please respect operational rigor as not just a budget tool but consider the impact and investment also to the teams and respect the people more than just a number.

Pros
Well organized, good benefits, many successful products. Is truly an equal opportunity employer.

Cons
A lot of process, sometimes hard to get work done Does not encourage telecommute, even though sells products to enable this at other companies. Some very bad managers, but most are excellent. The bad ones cause a lot of havoc, but Cisco seems unable to handle them Salary is in the 60-100 percentile, so not the best paymaster. Most people get no stocks.

Pros
Laid back environment, good amount of training opportunities. Good internal network, if you last for a decent amount of time and want to move around

Cons
The project I was on got terminated less than 2 months into the 18 months the contract was listed (and supposedly pre-funded) to last. The entire team was let go without notice, and Cisco (nor the agency we worked through) did not issue any notice nor severance. This is unacceptable, and a very horrible business practice that shows the management doesn't know how to plan and doesn't care about it's staff. It's understandable that contract employees ("red" badge ad Cisco calls them) are contingent, but there is no reason an 18 month project shouldn't be have guaranteed funding/payout for at least 3 months or a reasonable notice given. Many folks on the team (myself included) left permanent jobs to take what we were told was a great opportunity to join Cisco and become part of a long-term project, team, with possible conversion to full-time "blue badge" employees. I've heard numerous horror stories from other folks in my network, former employees and contractors as well as recruiters. This seems to be "business as usual" at Cisco and the cost associated with bringing in new staff and quickly getting rid of them...is very wasteful. In many other ways, I noticed the hand does not know what the foot is doing at this company, during my short time there. The team I worked with was originally a startup that Cisco acquired some years ago, they all absolutely HATED the "Cisco way of doing things", which was nearly impossible to get anything done.

Advice to Senior Management
Stop being wasteful, and plan your projects better. Simple processes such as ordering new employees a computer or creating an account should be approved and happen at the click of a button....not take two and a half weeks!!!

From Cisco Systems Technical Support Manager (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — 4 of 4 found this helpful — Mon, 10 Aug 2015

Pros
Excellent benefits and starting pay is competitive.

Cons
Raises are almost non-existent. Raises do occur, but they seem to be only for a small section of employees at the absolute top of the performance scale or who have made the right impression with senior leadership. So you can do a great job and not see a penny more for 3 or more years. So while the world becomes more expensive to live in, you are are having less an less expendable income. If this methodology resulted in more job security it would be worth it, but it is just Cisco&#039;s normal business model to force management into stack ranking exercises to determine who could be fired. Also, Cisco does not value most experience gained outside of Cisco. So you may have years of experience coming in the door, you will not be considered for promotions until you have gained the same experience under Cisco.

Advice to Senior Management
Implement cost of living raises at a minimum. This alone would have a dramatic effect on employee satisfaction.

From Cisco Systems Video Release Engineer (Current Employee) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Mon, 10 Aug 2015

Pros
My position allows me to work remotely from home which has been a big benefit with young kids at home. I also love not having to travel an hour each way to the office.

Cons
The pay is not up to par with other companies for similar positions. In my role, I remotely support customers, and therefore I can only work with a very small part of their entire environment which can be frustrating at times.

From Cisco Systems Staff Software Engineer (Past Employee - 2011) — Rating 5.0 out of 5 — Mon, 10 Aug 2015

Pros
Cisco benefits and business ethics are great. They are technology leaders and have a lot of interesting work to do. They treat employees well and with respect.

Cons
Doing software in a hardware company always has the big question of whether the software is there to sell the hardware or if the software is a product in itself. This can lead to a tiring tug of war on this topic and recurring reorganizations.

Advice to Senior Management
Recognize and account for software as both marketing collateral and product. Make the hardware side pay retail for the software investment, not just to hire a head.

Subject:	A Cisco Systems Manager, Software Development says "Company trying to Re-invent itself"

From Cisco Systems Manager, Software Development (Current Employee) — Rating 3.0 out of 5 — Sat, 8 Aug 2015

Pros
- Competitive salary with good bonus plan puts them towards the high end of the pay scale - Most teams allow flex-time and working from home when needed - Excellent collaboration tools to support workers

Cons
- Annual lay-offs (6 out of last 7 years) at end of fiscal year (July) - Frequent re-organizations - Burdensome/rigid processes and design leverage from previous products stifle creativity and new approaches

Advice to Senior Management
I certainly understand the companies efforts to re-invent itself and focus on Security and Cloud but why do you overlook the talent you already have. Rather than lay-off experienced and knowledgable talent every year - why don't you work to re-train the people that got you where you are. Your people are able to twist existing products into new designs and applications - perhaps they could do it with their careers as well if given an opportunity.

From Cisco Systems Supply Chain Operations Intern (Past Employee - 2012) — Rating 4.0 out of 5 — Fri, 7 Aug 2015

Pros
I was a summer intern in the supply chain and I had a fantastic time! Great coworkers who were always willing to help, fun perks, competitive salary, and a real-world look at what industry is like. The people I worked with really made me feel appreciated too, and that was a huge plus.

Cons
While I got good experience and lots to talk about in interviews, I don't know how much my work actually helped the company. Near the end of my internship I got the feeling that the interns from the year before had done the exact same projects we were assigned to do, making it almost feel like our time was wasted. I wish our projects had more of an impact on the company.

Advice to Senior Management
Continue to have interns! You cultivate a respect and a love for your company with us. And please continue to treat us well!
